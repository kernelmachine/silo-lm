Having read much about the exploits of Octavianus from the standard classical and contemporary commentators, this biography by Anthony Everitt stands out as not only thorough, but so well written as to make it engaging to read, something which one cannot easily say about Suetonius or Plutarch! Everitt compiles the writings of these ancient sources, but also intersperses the biography with interesting contextual and archaeological information. In instances where sources contradict or seem far fetched, Everitt shows remarkable temperance - he often comments on what he may think have been the case, but gives you all the information so as to formulate your own opinion as well.

Derrida's refusal to be a subject, mentioned by another reviewer, is one of the very few interesting elements of this film. In one of my two favourite scenes, Derrida points out the inherent tension between the viewers' expectations that they are 'seeing Derrida', and the fact that he is not the same when viewed by a camera. My other favourite scene is Derrida's response to question about which philosopher his mother would have been. This was probably the only good question in the whole film. Other than these two scenes, the film is filled with banal shots of Derrida's life that tell us little about Derrida the person and reveal nothing about his intellectual thought.

Michael Tilson-Thomas' reading with the CSO is miles better than this, the detail, especially in the 2nd and 4th movements (the most rhythmically complex and difficult to conduct and perform) is brought out to a wonderful degree. Ozawa simply buries a lot of this. Furthermore, Ozawa does not bring out the American folk tunes and hymns that Ives so cunningly weaves into the overall fabric of this eclectic work. Tilson-Thomas does all of this AND manages to make the 4 movements cohere symphonically, something that not many conductors of this piece can do. Ozawa just flounders, frankly.

I took off my camera strap (a.k.a the \"steal me\" strap) since it was always getting in the way of my shooting. I have a 24-105L and a EF 50mm 1.4 and they all fit it in this bag. The best setup I found is to have the 24-105 already mounted on the camera and then you simply place the 50mm in the next compartment. This is the smallest most discrete bag I have found for a full frame camera and is well padded and quite light. There is also some room for the charger, manual, and other small accessories.The 5D II is a pretty large camera so you should have no problems with cropped bodies such as canon Rebels and other smaller cameras.The gray color is much darker than the picture shows and is in fact almost black which is great since it doesn't really stick out (if that matters to you).

Others can't seem to help themselves; they add their own definitions which are often not funny or clever and are nowhere near authentic.

Mr. Autry presents his position on Servent Leadership, and makes all who read it examine themselves. It was great fun imagining a work place like the one Mr. Autry describes.First of all, the writing style is pleasent and engaging. Very inviting and not intimidating. It's like having a quite conversation with a peaceful man of letters. The book goes fast, so it's maybe three nights of reading time. The lessons contained are very penetrating. Self examination will be a good result of this book's reading.I particularly appreciated the section at the end of the book where 24 photos of a future company are examined. It gives hope to all of us, but sadly, I feel it's just too good to be true.Non the less, please read this book for your business soul, and maybe your business approach. It can help if we try to put it in place. Thanks Mr. Autry for the peace and humanity. It was", "uncond_input": " It was", "label_list": [" terrible", " great"], "gt_label": 1}

The drive in early capitalism, Weber shows, was an inherentreligious belief in money as a means of eternal salvation. Trough accumulating more wealth, capitalists were trying to prove for themselves that they were worthy of God's grace and hence were secured an afterlife in Paradise. However, spending money was not an option for these capitalists. It was considered a sin to use capital gains to satisfy carnal and worldly desires ( compare with Enron and Worldcom executives).

While Darkest Days, their previous record, was showing signs of decreasing hard rythms and emotional sound, I did not expect their next recording to fall so far beneath my expectations.The hard rock and industrial feel of Ungod and subsequent carryover to Whither, Blister, Burn and Peel is totally gone in the songs on the new self-titled CD.To me, all of the feeling has been stripped of their music. Even the haunting voice Chris Hall normall sings with is vanished. Though it pains me to say so, anyone who was a fan of previous Stabbing Westward efforts would probably not enjoy this CD.

Kuhn's contribution had four positive elements: a) Mechanism of crisis: precipitation and resolution, b) Analogy of the historicity of science with evolution c) that science rewrites its own history, and d) psychology of paradigm shifts; that the paradigm is not completely defined by explicit prescription but also by a system of practices that are not fully articulated. In summary, Change is difficult. Human Beings resist change. However, the process has been set in motion long ago and we will continue to co-create our own experience. Kuhn (1996) states, \"awareness is prerequisite to all acceptable changes of theory\" (p. 67). It all begins in the mind of the person. What we perceive, whether normal or metanormal, conscious or unconscious, are subject to the limitations and distortions produced by our inherited and socially conditional nature.

Yet, the subtitle of the book is \"practicing personal accountability at work and in life\", and, sorry, you can't practice accountability if you don't know what it is...Oh, and the phrase \"personal accountability\" is a redundancy -- there is no accountability other than that which is personal.

This single, with all four of its songs being phenomenal Goo Goo Dolls hits, is great as both a sample of what they are capable of and as a small chronology as well. There are four songs here, each one from a different album. \"Here Is Gone\" comes from their 2002 release of Gutterflower, and wonderfully captures the level of emotion they creat in their songs. \"Burnin' Up\" from 1995's A Boy Named Goo is a great punk-grunge song by Robby. \"We Are the Normal\" from Superstar Car Wash is a wonderful anthemic power-pop masterpiece. Finally, \"Two Days In February\" from Hold Me Up is one of their earliest acoustic ballads, and it's a beautiful one.

This is very typical of compact digital cameras. This is due to the small size of the cameras and small batteries. It is all a compromise. For most shooting this is not a problem as you can usually shoot without flash or are within range. However many times you need more flash range when shooting in large rooms, museums, concerts, and public places. The HF-DC1 solves this problem by giving you more range - up to 30 feet. This flash works with many Canon models, check the Canon Website or your camera owners manual for complete details.It is a must have for Canon digital camera owners. Highly recommended !
