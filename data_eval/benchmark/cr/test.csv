0,"weaknesses are minor : the feel and layout of the remote control are only so-so ; . it does n 't show the complete file names of mp3s with really long names ; . you must cycle through every zoom setting ( 2x , 3x , 4x , 1/2x , etc . ) before getting back to normal size [ sorry if i 'm just ignorant of a way to get back to 1x quickly ] ."

0,player has a problem with dual-layer dvd 's such as alias season 1 and season 2 .
0,"i know the saying is "" you get what you pay for "" but at this stage of game dvd players must have better quality than this - there is no excuse ."
0,will never purchase apex again .
0,customer service and technical support are overloaded and non responsive - tells you about the quality of their products and their willingness to stand behind them .
0,"then my dvds would stop playing in the middle , or not even be read at all ."
0,new cds almost always began skipping after a few plays .
0,"i thought it was just the player , but then i started checking the discs to find that the apex 2600 is actually ruining my media ."
0,this player is not worth any price and i recommend that you do n 't purchase it .
0,apex does n 't answer the phone .
0,no way to contact their customer service .

0,the door would not close .
0,i tried to contact apex to return it ( i missed the amazon return period ) and it took 3 months to get through to their customer service dept .
0,"unfortunately it turns out to be the "" disposable "" type ."
0,have had problems since the first day
0,"- not playing some dvds and then finally after less than 60 days , it just would not recognize anything i pop in it ."
0,it does tend to run quite hot and should be given lots of room for air circulation .

0,"the only thing i did experience was a problem of the player freezing while playing , which i was able to clear by opening it up and blowing it out with "" canned air . """
0,"the remote is okay , but i am not a fan of remotes with tiny buttons ."
0,"i especially like the more commonly used buttons , such as play , pause , and stop , to be larger and conveniently placed ."
0,i also did n 't like the way it displayed information way down into the screen when you are in zoom mode .
0,"the zoom goes up and down in magnification , which is nice , but there is always a display of the zoom size about one-quarter of the way down from the top of the screen that interferes with viewing at most settings ."
0,"having spent considerable time with professional video gear , i find onscreen displays annoying ."
0,it is more than 90 days and it does not show the picture no matter what i do .
0,"i have had this player for 3 months and have been able to see a total of 6 dvd 's , after the frustration and aggravation of getting the player to do it 's job ."
0,i have tried many times to get a hold of apex who does n 't seem to answer their emails and telephone number is constantly busy as ( i believe ) the one lonely customer service rep is probably extremely overworked .
0,wo n 't play a lot of discs .
0,"some movies it played yesterday , it wo n 't play today ."

0,tech support from apex is literally - nonexistent .
0,i bought 2 of this model for christmas presents and neither one of them work ! .
0,it is embarassing getting phone calls from family members telling you that the dvd player you gave them less that 3 months ago is no longer working .
0,the dvd player does not work properly .
0,"the player usually plays dvd 's , but has occasional problems such as : 1 ) not recognizing a dvd 2 ) stopping a particular point in a movie every time we played it 3 ) not being able to access certain special features on a rental dvd ."
0,"this has happened with several different dvd 's and occasionally if we keep trying something , it will work when it did not work one time before ."
0,"after we discovered the problems , we tried to contact apex ( flor 3 months ) , but we never got in touch with them . the customer support telephone number is always busy , and they do not answer their web customer support ."
0,unfortunately it can 't play all of the dvd .
0,on 2 dvds so far it refuses to play certain episodes with no problems on the others on the dvd .

0,"but when we went to use it again , there was sound but no picture ."
0,"i hate apex but love amazon , and i tell everyone ."
0,"who knows how many uses you 'll get out of it before it craps out , but it probably will ."

0,"( on here of course ) also , a couple dvd 's would n 't play and they were new ones ! ."
0,i had to return the remote on this product because it appeared to be defective .
0,the customer service dept did not list a toll free number and it was a real hassle to get through on their regular line .
0,i would not be inclined to purchase an apex product again .
0,door broke after a month .
0,unit took forever since the beginning to recognize and play discs .
0,3 months of use and it no longer recognizes anything .
0,"after @ 3 months , it stopped playing higher number scenes on dvds ."
0,"as an engineer , i am embarrassed for the engineering profession when such crap is released for sale ."
0,only used for 3 month before it 's down ! .
0,"it sends discontinuous signals to tv , so the tv has the pictures for one moment and has only the white noise for the other moment ."
0,the other thing i do n 't like about this 2600 is that it makes the color look over saturated .
0,the entire unit was poorly crafted .
0,there were sharp screw tips on the underside of the unit coming from inside that were obviously used to anchor the internal control board .
0,"after hooking the thing up , i found that it would only played less than 50 % of the dvds i put in it ."
0,the dvd player just would 't recognize them .
0,"it would spin , read , spin some more and then show on the display that there was no disc ."
0,i have not even used my new dvd player and already i am disappointed ! .
0,they will not respond to my emails ( promised turnaround time is 24 hours ) and the phone line is constantly busy .
0,now i know why - they are pieces of junk .
0,"less than a month later the screen freezes and eventually shows "" no disc . """
0,same story as everybody else when trying to get service from apex - nothing .
0,this unit was working fine for the 1st month and a half and then the color signal disappeared .
0,apex has still not responded to my email describing the problem after almost a week and their customer service line is always busy .
0,this dvd play is basically junk .
0,it wo n 't play all of my movies .
0,"i tried called apex cu st service , no help ."
0,"mine was 2 weeks old and i chucked it in the trash , where it belongs ."
0,each of the 4 lasted less than six months .
0,i have sent my ad2600 back to apex because it wo n 't play certain disney and other dvd movies ( no disc message ) .
0,"one bad thing though , i find the remote-control a bit flimsy and i predict it will most probably ' die ' before the player does ."
0,"i purchased two of these players for christmas gifts , and both were bad ."
0,the first one would n 't work from the start .
0,the second lasted about two weeks before the video went out ! .
0,"i have tried several times to contact apex digital through their on-line support site and their telephone line , but they wo n 't answer my emails and their telephone line is always busy ."
0,"but about 25 % of dvd 's i 've played on it have a problem , when watching a movie the picture will freeze , but the dvd still plays , and eventually the picture kicks back in after skipping a few moments ."
0,we have had this product for over a month and yesterday it stopped working .
0,there was neither picture nor sound .
0,i would have rated it five stars but for the poor manual .
0,it worked from 12-26 to 1-9 at which time the picture failed completely ( see other negative reviews-my unit was n 't the only one this happened to . )
0,"i tried calling the support number for a week , several times a day , and always got a busy signal ."
0,neither message was answered ( they ask for 24 hours before replying - i 've been waiting 27 days . )
0,"it only read the dvds 10 % of the time , otherwise i would get a no disc screen ."
0,"i 've had this player for several months and it reads most discs , but it would not recognize several discs that were clean and read on other players ( from friends season 2 ) ."
0,"it would just spin up and stop , and display "" no disc "" ."
0,"my other gripe is the incredibly crappy remote , which is worse than other , cheaper apex units ."
0,you have to press the buttons hard and frequently i end up pressing enter when i meant to scroll .
0,"also , for some reason the picture looks washed out on s-video , with lots of color bleeding , compared to a component connection ( should not be much of a perceptible difference on a 27 "" tv ) ."
0,"and the remote is cheap and ch easy - not sure how long it 'll last , but for 50 bucks what the heck ! ."
0,after about an hour it starts skipping like the dvd 's are dirty .
0,i have ice age and it keeps telling me no disc .
0,i tried e-mailing apex and they come back saying undeliverable .
0,i 've tried leaving questions on their site never to have them answered .
0,it has never worked .
0,"i 've attempted to connect this unit to several different tvs , using a multitude of connection methods , and i still can 't get a video signal from the machine ."
0,purchased the ad-2600 about a month ago and have had numerous problems with it .
0,the most recent is that it will stop responding to the on/off button .
0,they claim to respond in a 24 hour period yet it 's been 2 weeks without a reply .
0,i 've sent 10 e-mails to their customer service department requesting an ra with no response .
0,3/4 way through the first disk we played on it ( naturally on 31 days after purchase ) the dvd player froze .
0,now it will not load any disk or just says that there is no disk .
0,"have tried to contact apex via e-mail ( customerservice@apexdigital . com ) , but the e-mail address is not valid ."
0,"have tried calling ( 866-4apexgo ) , but can 't get through ."
0,"this product sucks , the customer service from apex sucks ."
0,"after using it for just a month , i could not play any dvd ."
0,i can only hear the sound but no picture ! .
0,their customer ( www . apex digital inc . com ) service is very poor .
0,one of the dvd 's i received as a christmas present kept freezing .
0,some dvd 's i rented would not play .
0,"when the player was working it was great , but ."
0,"first of all , i bought this dvd as a christmas present for my girlfriend and i am somewhat disappointed ."
0,what disappointed me is the fact that it does not seem to read certain dvds .
0,"for example , i tried playing my new "" pirates of the caribbean "" extra features dvd , but this dvd player can not read it ."
0,"at first i thought it is only a isolated incident , but i was proven wrong when the player would not read my "" alias "" dvds as well ."
0,"because of this , i am disappointed and would not recommend this product ."
0,after two weeks the picture kept freezing .
0,apex sucks ! .
0,unit worked great for 3 weeks then video output failed .
0,"the catch is that , while it plays movies just fine , it has refused to read second discs with the movie "" extras "" on them on the two occasions when i tried to do that ."
0,the remote is a little hard to understand .
0,"my jpeg pictures are viewable ( not so sharp and vivid ) on my 27 "" screen but seem not as clear as when i view them on my 17 "" monitor ."
0,video output stopped working .
0,"this was an awesome player , before the video output no longer worked ( after about 3 weeks ) ."
0,what a disappointment ! .
0,there was occasionally a lip-sync issue ( the lips were n 't moving in time to the dialog ) .
0,"but after 10 days , the sound worked , but the video quit working ."
0,"output went black and white only via both s-video and composite connections , and with no v-hold ."
0,p . s the remote control does seem to get confused at times and doesnt respond but it may be just operator error ? .
0,what the hell is wrong with this thing .
0,forget about the sleek looks if it can 't play some of your real dvds .
0,"well , within 45 days the video output quit working ( both rca & optic ) ."
0,"so now it still plays everything , you just can 't see it ! ."
0,"the first one we installed did n 't work , and our kids were devastated to say the least ."
0,update : january 27th 2004 - the second one crapped out only after a week - dont buy this product ! .
0,i immediately had problems getting the player to recognize two of my favorite dvds .
0,"after multiple tries , one of the disks was finally recognized but video was poor and features not available ."
0,only one disk played through to completion successfully .
0,"when we tried to hook up the first one , it was broken - the motor would not eject discs or close the door ."
0,"when i tried to install the second dvd player in my brothers house , that one didn "" t work either ! ."
0,imagine my shock - and absolute instant disdain for any products made by apex .
0,the 2nd dvd player had a faulty power supply which caused to occasionally not turn on .
0,the ad-1600 did n 't work correctly from the start and the ad-1220 lasted about a week and a half before it started to act up .
0,"the front door is miss aligned on my unit and you have to manually life it up just so slightly for the door to close , a very annoying thing after ah wile ."
0,"we tried the "" finding memo "" dvd and when we got to ~ chapter 28 , the frames started to freeze for no reason ."
0,i can 't rate it one star only because when it does work it 's pretty good .
0,only owned it about two weeks so i expect we 're looking at getting another progressive scan dvd player of higher quality very soon .
0,"the player kept displaying "" no disc "" , so i tried the disc in another machine and sure as @ # * ! ."
0,"1 ) frame freezes and the family yells , "" dad ! . somethings wrong with the dvd player ! . come quick ! . """
0,"2 ) the remote works , but then it does not work , and you are left standing there thinking you are doing something wrong ."
0,5 ) this apex model 2600 will not work with my universal remote control .
0,finally you will read a post somewhere that all codes are useless for the apex 2600 .
0,"one still works fine , the other quit after one day ."
0,apex 's website is down and they wo n 't answer their phone .
0,it seems to be a little slow when identifying a new disc that 's inserted - maybe 10 seconds of wait .
0,"when i hooked it up it only produced sound - a cd played fine , but with a dvd i only got the audio - no picture ! ."
0,"seemed like a good deal , but this pps frequently can not recognize dvds and music cds -- takes a long time loading and then concludes , "" no disc "" ."
0,"granted , i have only used this dvd player for about 2 hours setting it up for my mom for christmas , but that was long enough for me to find problems with this dvd player ."
0,"first , the player did not allow me to access the menus of dvds ."
0,this is extremely lame .
0,the remote is flimsy-feeling and awkward to use .
0,"in addition , it only seems to work if you 're about five feet away from the player , although that may have been just the batteries that came with it ."
0,"after less than 24 hours it turned out to be a huge disappointment , for myself and for my parents , for whom it was a gift ."
0,"it played only one out of three dvd 's without problems , the other two being afflicted by a number of glitches ."
0,"both of the problem dvd 's would repeatedly freeze during playback , while the counter on the player kept going ."
0,one also exhibited extremely slow speed when going to the menu .
0,the dvd door would scratch the top of the disc every time it closed .
0,"all in all , trying to save some money on this player resulted in me shelling a great deal more when i purchased a much nicer dvd vcr combo player to make up for blazing creepiness of this very embarassing gift ."
0,"i was impressed by this very inexpensive player . for the first three hours , and then it died ."
0,"there are a couple of quirks that were a bit annoying like having to actually press the power button before the tray will open ( my perv . machine did it automatically ) , and the fact that the external display is too small and too faded to read from any significant distance ."
0,i get to chapter 34 and everything freezes ! .
0,i try navigating to a chapter past 34 via the menu and it would n 't do it ! .
0,"i try navigating using the player 's built in menu , and it still would n 't work ! ."
0,"unfortunately , the player would not read any of my region one dvds . even though they were not damaged in any way ."
0,i called apex 's support number numerous times but it just kept ringing .
0,"the build quality shows why its so cheap - small scratches on the base plate , something that you would n 't see on a sony and an overall plastic feel"
0,"remote buttons are small and closely spaced , especially with the menu buttons ."
0,the one i purchased for a friend as a gift will not read any dvd disc .
0,"however , it has failed to deliver on quality ."
0,"it does not only have difficulty playing jpegs , it even has trouble properly playing dvd movies ."
0,"on several different occasions it has displayed "" no disc "" with a disc inside ."
0,"i read in consumer reports that apex is a reliable brand , but with my experience and reading the other reviews , i think i will be doing a little more homework before considering another apex product ."
0,the 2600 had false silver plate instead of play display .
0,"however , it does not play windows media and i can not get it to play any of my dix rips ."
0,"can 't say whether i rec 'd an "" updated "" model but it will not read dvd + rw 's or vcd 's for me ."
0,* main dial is not backlit .
0,* lens visible in optical viewfinder .
0,"the lens is visible in the viewfinder when the lens is set to the wide angle , but since i use the lcd most of the time , this is not really much of a bother to me ."
0,"the reason i rated it a four is because of that darn diopter adjustment dial . its very small and hard to turn so you can 't get an accurate adjustment ( for those of you who do n 't know what a diopter adjustment is , it is to adjust the focus of the viewfinder to your eyesight . )"
0,"1 ) quite bulky ( it 's about the same size as my minolta vectors s-1 aps slr ) and uses a heavy battery , although not very solid as it is contracted mostly of plastic ( unlike canon 's elph line )"
0,2 ) not very ergonomically - you 'll find even for a point-and-shoot lens )
0,4 ) the viewfinder is bordered lcd skying .
0,the only two minor issues i have with the camera are the lens cap ( it is not very snug and can come off too easily ) and the lens itself ( it partially obstructs the view through the viewfinder but not views through the lcd ) .
0,the only drawback is the viewfinder is slightly blocked by the lens .
0,"b ) the lens cover is surely loose , i already accidently finger-printed the len a few times , and au lens ti gt and cause potential damage ."
0,"the zooming lever is shaky , i hope it does not operate mechanically , otherwise you 'll feel uneasy ."
0,"maybe it is my lack of experience , but i found shots with this camera very disappointing ."
0,it was ( i sold it after a few months ) too expensive for the shots that i got .
0,"sure it had all the features , but when i tried to shoot a girl 's basketball game it just wan 't up to the task ."
0,i found that low light situations combined with any sort of action left this camera in the dust .
0,the grain was terrible .
0,"well flash photos are never great , and there was still a lot of noise ."
0,"the two limitations i knew i would have to deal with are the very long lag time before it focus-locks ( even in bright light ) , and the unsatisfactory light quality of the built-in flash ."
0,"relative to what i can easily achieve with external flash on my nikon slr , the internal flash on the g3 produces harsh , flat images with ugly hot spots ."
0,"now there is one more complaint i have about the g3 and that is the software that comes with it for processing raw images ( i only shoot in raw image mode and the first thing i did was replace the 32 mbyte cf with a 512 mbyte cf , which gives me 130 raw images , as opposed to 7 ! ."
0,"the canon software for raw images does not present you with a raw image at all , but the raw image after it has been processed by all the image-affecting settings in the camera ."
0,what the g3 raw image software gives you is a fantasy world designed to please the uncritical .
0,about the only legitimate criticism from the online reviews is that fact that the lens really does obstruct the viewfinder .
0,the g3 had problems focusing in low light and would not take the picture when the shutter was pressed but after the shutter had been released a few seconds .
0,got way too many blurry pictures .
0,"the catch with the canon g3 camera , ( and perhaps all of digital cameras ) is that its unresponsiveness will cause you to miss precious shots ."
0,it sometimes takes the picture at some indefinite period of time after you press the shutter button .
0,canon 's g3 does it consistently .
0,"it feels slow to focus , and unbearably slow to shoot ."
0,"unfortunately , this digital moment-capturing device called the g3 sometimes captures the moment after the one you wanted ."
0,1 ) the included lens cap is very loose on the camera .
0,"2 ) the body construction - buttons , casing , etc , are too plastic ."
0,it had a heavier and more sturdy casing .
0,"one little minor flaw with this camera is that the lens is visible in the viewfinder , but does not detract from the image at all ."
0,you can see the lens barrel in the view-finder .
0,"( i knew this before hand , and it is not that bad ) there is no tiff format ."
0,it seems to me that after the focus and metering are complete there is quite a lag before the shutter ? .
0,"one bad thing is that it comes with a pitiful 32mb compactflash card , and for most purposes , it is not enough ."
0,the included memory card is too small .
0,it is made of plastic .
0,the zoom lens unit feels fragile and it is worth buying a good camera bag if you are going put to carry it round a lot .
0,"while light , it will not easily go in small handbags or pockets ."
0,the function lever - the one which switches between capture and view mode feels fragile .
0,"flash - as with all built-in flashes in small cameras , you get over illuminated main subjects with depth being lost ."
0,the strap is horrible and gets in the way of parts of the camera you need access to .
0,"yes there is a corner lens barrel distortion ( i do n 't like it too but no harm done since i always use the cam ea lcd screen to see exactly what i 'm going to get ) in the viewfinder when you do n 't zoom ( when you zoom the lens distortion goes away ) , canon knows this and engineered it that way to minimize the parallax phenomenon ; . that is what lamest exactly ot the picture ."
0,"to address two previous somewhat negative reviews : ( 1 ) yes , the lens barrel does obstruct part of the lower left corner in the lens viewfinder ; . however , the lcd viewfinder is rather stunning and i find myself rarely using the lens viewfinder ."
0,this camera has a major design flaw .
0,when you look through the viewfinder ( not the lcd ) the bottom left corner of the picture ( about 15 % ) is blocked by the lens .
0,"i 've been bothered by blown-out highlights on the s330 , and the g3 seems to do only slightly better ."
0,"the on-off button feels somewhat flimsy , and has an awkward , tiny little lock-out button that needs to be depressed to turn on the camera ."
0,"and the body / construction in general has quite a bit of plastic , a disappointment after the stainless steel heft of the s330 ."
0,"the only minor nits i have with the camera are it is fairly boxy looking , it needs a wrist strap instead of a neck strap , and it is a bit slow between shots ."
0,"i thought given all the "" 10 "" reviews about this camera that i would buy it in spite of being a bit pricey ."
0,i did see the review here and other places about a cracked lcd screen .
0,"when i went to put in the new sd card i looked at the lcd screen -- cracked -- and the fluid gave a jackson pollock type appearance to the screen , black and blue and purple blotches and streaks -- useless ."
0,some more manual control would have been nice .
0,the only knock i have is that the flash is underpowered .
0,"after reading reviews of lcd problems , cracked , black blobs etc , i figured that it was probably a very limited problem ."
0,after 57 pictures total the lcd went black except for the icons showing the settings .
0,you can set the optical zoom before shooting and than while shooting video adjust a digital zoom in and out however due to the cameras light weight camera shake is a problem to contend with .
0,"the disadvantages of this camera is it has been having some trouble with its autofocus on a few occasional pictures , especially quick candid shots where you start up and shot as quick as you can ."
0,i would imagine this is a problem with any camera of a compact nature .
0,also as someone who at least knows a little bit about the technical work of taking a photo i really miss having manual controls .
0,battery life is not long enough if and only if you take a lot of video clips and play it back on the camera a lot of times . . . the camera/battery gets a little bit warm too when you use it for a long time but it 's normal .
0,the sound is not loud enough when i play back the video clips on the camera .
0,only downside is when taking pictures in low-light conditions without the flash .
0,"the sd500 has only been in my possession for a little over 3 months , and the lcd has been broken twice ."
0,i took it out one day and the lcd was not working .
0,"although the sd500 takes great quality photos , the sensitivity of the lcd compromises the quality overall ."
0,"i also own a canon digital rebel and i agree that the advanced controls on the sd500 are not as robust , but overall picture quality goes head-to-head with the digital rebel ."
0,the only problem i have with the buttons is that the power button and print/share button don 't have a nice click .
0,the buttons are rather stiff .
0,some adjustments in the settings could help make it better .
0,i thought this camera was awful and i did tons of research on cnet and other sites .
0,there were many times when i clicked the automatic shutter and nothing happens .
0,"the controls are hard to manipulate , especially in the dark ."
0,the lcd screen is too small since there are so many cameras that have larger ones .
0,the only thing i don 't like is the small size ( 8 meg ) memory card that comes with it .
0,"i have to move pictures off of it every day so i have room for more pictures the next , and i don 't have enough money to buy the 256 meg card that i 've had my eye on for a while ."
0,a larger memory card and extra battery are good things to buy .
0,"other than that pictures taken in the dark are not as nice as i 'd like them ,"
0,"first off , the battery ."
0,"this camera uses a lithium battery , i find lithium batteries to be highly inconvenient ; . because what if you are on vacation , where the nearest place to buy batteries is just a gas station -- there is no way that you are going to find lithium batteries there ."
0,"not only is it inconvenient , but also the battery life span is short ."
0,"this isn 't uncommon in cameras , though , just as long as you bring your charger and spare batteries , you should be fine ."
0,another problem i had with this camera was the zoom function .
0,such a small zoom length that you would think that the zoom would be silent since it hardly zooms in . . . wrong ! .
0,the zoom function on this camera is so loud that sometimes you will be unable to use it if you find yourself in a situation where you must be quiet .
0,"even just turning the camera on will move the lens a little , resulting in a noisy start-up ."
0,the flash is very weak .
0,the last problem i found with this camera was the macro function .
0,the auto-focus on the camera seems to have trouble focusing on the subject .
0,"to make matters work , there is no manual override to overcome this problem ."
0,"it 's not my first choice in cameras ,"
0,1 ) it is perhaps too small .
0,i find it a bit difficult to manage the very tiny buttons and impossible to read the icons without my reading glasses on .
0,its size makes holding it steady for long a bit of a challenge ( not enough camera body to grip with more than your finger tips ) .
0,2 ) the delay from the time you fully depress the shutter to the time the picture is taken is too long and may yield some fuzzy shots .
0,this is due to the unusually slow autofocus system .
0,"3 ) the lack of an intermediate resolution setting , as other reviewers have suggested , is a problem , but that problem is meaningless with a larger compactflash memory card"
0,4 ) the camera gets really hot when you are busy snapping away .
0,it is hot enough to be annoying .
0,i left the camera in my car in maine ( not a very hot place ) and the lcd screen cracked ! .
0,i then realized a major design flaw .
0,all the camera 's functionality is only available ( or selectable ) when the screen is functional .
0,"when the screen stops working , you 're out of luck ! ."
0,the viewfinder does not accurately represent the picture being taken .
0,the digital zoom is crap .
0,the pictures are a little dark sometimes .
0,the movie mode can only record a max of 30 seconds at 160x120 per clip and a max of 4 seconds at 640x480 .
0,the price is $ . . . more .
0,i originally gave this camera 5 stars . when i had windows 98 it was wonderful but i got a new computer last november with xp the usb software is soho . . . not compatible with xp
0,the new drivers on cannon 's site do not help at all but try them if you want they have made me have to use the backup software .
0,the adobe software also was wonderful in 98 but it will not let you print correctly with xp so you are forced to create your document then either print it from windows or export it to another application .
0,"the only thing i don 't like about it is that you have to buy a larger memory card , first thing ! ."
0,my only complaint and the reason i gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is that the on-camera controls aren 't as intuitive as they should be .
0,"i 've often struggled to get something to work the way i want it , and hate to have to carry the manual with me all the time ! ."
0,"all that said , i am a little disappointed with the quality of the pictures from the camera ."
0,"when taking pictures of people , however , it shows every flaw in the subject 's skin ."
0,other cameras taking pics of the same subjects turn out looking much better .
0,i will also say that it takes a very long moment for the camera to do its digital image processing between the time you press the button and when the camera actually takes the picture .
0,i 'd give it 5 stars if the automatic modes were better and if there were true manual focus and exposure modes .
0,"for example , in auto mode you can 't use the flash redeye reduction , you must be in manual mode for that ."
0,the auto color balance is often fooled by dense clouds .
0,the dynamic range seems not quite as good as the kodak dc260 .
0,"8- buttons are little , but if you have steady fingers and deal ed with a casio worst calculator watch , you can deal with almost anything ."
0,"buttons size is ok for me , my wife , but not my granny ."
0,"sometimes the pictures are on the dark side , but i 'm able to fix that using the photoshop 6 . 0 "" adjust levels "" function . . . not sure how a person would do that without photoshop , though ."
0,"only 1 problem , no accessories . . . yet ."
0,"i hope it 's because it 's new and they are not out yet , but being without a remote is hard ."
0,"you 're going to need to buy new headphones , the stock ones suck"
0,navigation is a bit tricky and takes getting used to but the included pdf instructions cover the operation pretty well .
0,"it could be a little bit bigger , but it 's easy to get used to ."
0,"the screen may be a little smaller , but it is very readable and does n 't come in the overused blue ."
0,"it does n 't have firewire , not a real complaint since most windows users do n 't generally have firewire cards themselves ."
0,"the only complaint i have is that when you push in the scroll wheel to select , you have to push straight in or it sticks ."
0,"the only downside i see is that it does n 't look like you can manage playlists from the nomad , it has to be done from the computer ."
0,the main problem with the nomad jukebox zen xtra 30 gb is the software .
0,"the interface software itself , which should be user-friendly , was anything but easy-to-use ."
0,the player itself has all sorts of problems .
0,"the face-plate , which pops out for the battery , pops open by itself every 10 minutes or so ."
0,"the player hangs up on file transfer every once-in-a-while , prompting a reset ."
0,the scroll button is overly sensitive at times ; . not sensitive enough at others .
0,depressing the scroll button ( for selecting ) is not always responsive .
0,the scroll bar problems make the task of creating playlists more frustrating .
0,"overall , a very disappointing product ."
0,"the setup process for the nomad is infuriating , and the interface with the player is sub-par ."
0,the player 's mechanics are also flawed .
0,"although the sound-quality is good , it takes more than good sound on a portable-mp 3 player to result in a good product ."
0,"one beef is the scroll , it does n 't work as well as i 'd like ."
0,deficiencies with zennx are easily overcome with 3rd-party earphones ( $ 20 + ) and software ( $ 25 ) .
0,getting the program to install properly has been a living hell experience .
0,"also , the instruction manual is very bad ."
0,transfering - i could not get my songs to completely transfer via usb 1 . 1 or 2 . 0 .
0,"it would only transfer 30 or so songs , and then come up with an error ."
0,"scroll button - the scroll wheel was a nice idea to keep less clutter , but the button would sometimes get stuck or keep scrolling ."
0,size - bigger than the ipod
0,"software - music match jukebox is n 't the greatest , the search function is n 't fast even when accessing it with the hot key shortcut ."
0,"all i have to say is that i did freeze on me once , but it has n 't done it since ."
0,"first , the cons . . . a tad bulky . . . not the most aesthetic looking player . . . and does n 't support a folder structure ."
0,the cons are n 't really a big deal to me . . . except one con that does annoy me is the way it stores files . . . no folder structure . . . and it 's based on the title of the songs . . . many of my songs where separated into folders ( on the pc ) . . . and a few had same titles . . . so i had to change the titles to make sure that i did n 't have any that might be the same as another .
0,and man . . . i had to work to put my chinese songs on the player . . . because i had the actual chinese names of the songs as the title . .
0,the only thing i 'm concerned about is the quality / longevity of the buttons on the thing .
0,"my "" fast forward "" button works , but it takes a little extra pressure on it to make it go ."
0,"sure , it 's a little bigger than the ipod , but not by much ."
0,"unlike my 3 other mp3 players , this thing will only work properly if you have id3 tags on all of your tracks ."
0,"if you do n 't have tags , it 'll lump all of your tracks into the same directory and they can not be searched via artist or album as the zen does not recognize folders ."
0,i did have to put a little work into renaming some duplicate file names to get all my music on my zen xtra but it was n 't a big problem .
0,"the explorer program did shut down a couple times while i was renaming titles and changing genres but i did n 't have to reboot the computer or anything , just open up explorer again ."
0,the unit itself did lock up a few times and i had to hit the reset button but that was a fairly painless process as well .
0,the little jog dial seems weak and quirky and i hope i do n 't figure out a way to break it .
0,i have windows xp pro and when installing the enclosed software i did receive a message that there was a problem installing the driver .
0,"i 've tried the belkin fm transmitter unit with it & it worked well when i set it on top of a portable radio , but was awful trying to use in the car which is somewhat of a disappointment ."
0,- the controls are much inferior to the simple ipod ones .
0,the black fly wheel feels pretty cheap & is uncomfortable to use .
0,the locations of various buttons on one side or the other is somewhat illogical
0,- included creative software is pretty poor .
0,"i tried to play the song three times , with no success ."
0,"it would either not play the song at all , or skip wildly , no matter that the unit was resting on my desk ."
0,"had there been strange noises , or obvious defects , i would have accepted a replacement , but this is clearly from a defective and inferior operating system and i for one do not intend on waiting for patches ."
0,this product is too fragile for normal use .
0,"however , the creative software is not real intuitive ."
0,"the software is somewhat nice to look at , using it is not the easiest ."
0,"if you want to rename a cd title that you have already transferred , you will become frustrated quite quickly ."
0,this is ridiculous .
0,"the scroll wheel , to be blunt , sucks ."
0,seems it is always difficult to press to make a selection .
0,the interface used could be better designed .
0,it is a little cumbersome to scroll through so many levels to get to the selection you want .
0,"and the case , how did this ever make it out of quality control ."
0,"it is some protection for the unit , but for use ability , forget it ."
0,"the cut-outs for the controls is not thought out as there is too much material in the way to adequately access the controls , especially the scroll wheel ."
0,however the main reason i am not satisfied with this product is the fact that it will lock up at odd times .
0,"quite simply , the firmware and / or the os that control this thing is not ready for prime time ."
0,"i know this unit will have problems in the future and the $ 40 for the 2 year "" no questions asked "" replacement warranty will be worth it , since creative will only warrant it for 90 days - which in itself is totally ridiculous ! ."
0,"1 . the size is a little bit bigger than the ipod , and it weighs a little bit more ."
0,"2 . the scroll button is n 't the best , as it sometimes can be hard to select ."
0,i gave it only 3 stars due to the fact that the 1st one broke when i dropped it from a fairly short distance ( less than 2 ft ) .
0,1 ) fragile ( i broke the 1st one within 10 days )
0,2 ) scroll button / switch
0,3 ) the case hides the display - you have to open it to see what you are doing .
0,but for now it appears that this player does n 't play well with itunes .
0,the scroll bar is a bit of a pain .
0,i was a little disappointed in the low end .
0,the sound level is also not as high as i would have expected .
0,"in any case , navigation by artist / album is ok however i miss an ability to navigate by folders ."
0,"you even can not navigate by genre / artist / album since under genre you get just all tracks in that genre , no other division ."
0,"the software , which comes with player is not good at all ."
0,i did not managed to make creative nomad explorer to work .
0,"so yes , as with all software bundled with creative products , it was useless and ugly ."
0,this thing is trash .
0,"a ) feel cheap -- the plastic is feels like it would break very easily , and it definately wouldnt survive a drop"
0,b ) the screen is hard to read -- the cover hides it an already annoying poorly lit display
0,c ) the scroll bar is a travesty -- enough said
0,"d ) software is another great misfortune -- hard to operate , crashes frequently , screwed my music library up , doesnt work with mp4s , the list goes on and on"
0,e ) the case is too small -- it took me like a half hour just to get this monstrosity to fit in its cage
0,"f ) it doesnt look pretty -- spending this kind of cash , you want something that has the aesthetics bit down , of course"
0,the software failed repeatedly .
0,creative labs customer support website is useless .
0,software downloads on the site crashed my pc .
0,it has a few inconveniences : one is that the songs do not automatically play one after another like on a cd .
0,"another irrigation is that if you hold the scroll button down for too long , it keeps going past the song you may have wanted to stop on ."
0,"the case is strong and stylish , but unfortunately lacks a window ( now a big deal ) ."
0,on my main computer the software did not work right .
0,i had to sit on the phone with customer support for 2 hours and they did not help at all .
0,"the environmental audio , however , is almost completely useless and has made most of my songs sound worse than without it ( i encode my songs at 192-256 kbps without variable bit rates . )"
0,"yeah i agree the earbuds are pretty crap , replace them ."
0,1 ) a spare battery would have been great .
0,2 ) no games - it has a cool screen - why not use it .
0,"3 ) it does not work automatically like a hard drive when you connect it to your computer , like some players"
0,navigation system - the zen xtra uses id3 tags that are embedded in the mp3 files to organize your songs .
0,fm receiver - it has none .
0,cheap construction - they should have made the player out of hard plastic and put some rubber on the corners .
0,"the player feels very delicate , as if i 'm holding an actual hard drive ."
0,"as a portable player , it should feel a bit more durable ."
0,the songs do n 't play one after another like on a cd .
0,software - the software is crap .
0,"otherwise , it is difficult to figure out and awkward ."
0,"even after reading some of the instructions , it 's still hard to figure out ."
0,"no line out jack - as i said , there is none ."
0,"it sounds decent , but i would estimate you get maybe 80 % of the quality that you would from a true line out jack ."
0,controls are a bit awkward .
0,it was n 't as easy to fast forward or pause a song than it was with a regular walkman .
0,crappy headphones .
0,the included earbuds were uncomfortable .
0,"difficult navigation - i wo n 't necessarily say "" difficult , "" but i do n 't enjoy the scroll wheel to navigate ."
0,"it is a bit cumbersome , and i can 't get to the songs i want as quickly ."
0,i think this is it 's biggest flaw .
0,"up , down , left , and right would have given me better control ."
0,"if you hold down the scroll wheel too long ( which is common if you have a lot of songs to sort through ) , it will get "" stuck "" rapidly going through the songs and wo n 't stop until several seconds after you let your finger off of it ."
0,"it would have been much nicer if it had a window so you could see the screen , and if the button did n 't cover up the ac jack ."
0,"as it stands now , the case is pretty useless unless you 're packing the player up for travel , or if you load up all your songs beforehand ."
0,but the major problem i had was with the software .
0,the instructions that come with it do n 't explain how to make things simple .
0,the quick sync is n 't any good because it either needs to be configured properly or just is n 't very useful .
0,i tried to make sense of the file transfer program and just got more confused .
0,"the headphones are n 't the best , but you can really expect much out of the small headphones you insert in the ear cavity ."
0,creating playlists using the included software to minimize issue 3 was n 't as easy as i would have liked .
0,my only significant complaint is sound quality .
0,the eax sound enhancement feature did n 't do enough for me and the custom eq was a limited 5 band eq .
0,"i was unable achieve a sound quality on par with my simple portable cd player with "" bass boost . """
0,"well just one con - its not really plug and play at first i mean its very confusing to start the program but one you do it , it will be a breeze ."
0,my only complaint would be that you need id3 tags & that takes a while to do if your mp3 files do n 't have them .
0,"a little weighty ( 9 ounces . . . no biggie ) , but otherwise fine ."
0,but the earbuds suck ! .
0,"i forgot , the case does n 't fit ."
0,"my case doesnt close . . . maybe mine was just faulty , but the case isnt that great ."
0,what really made this a mediocre mp3 player for me was the software .
0,"bookmarks for example , are an excellent feature . . . but not on this player . . ."
0,"rather than creating a directory for bookmarks to be found in one area , the user must actually find the track where the bookmark was made . ."
0,this makes no sense and sort of defeats the purpose of audio bookmarks . . .
0,"the dynamic playlists ( "" now playing "" , i be live creative calls it ) feels very awkward at times and some menus simply take to long to get to and operate . . ."
0,"the controls are somewhat harder to use than the ipod , but i have gotten use to them , and even at the beginning did not think would justify the huge difference in price ."
0,"loading cds was somewhat time-consuming , but i think it would have been with the ipod as well ."
0,my only reservations about this product concern the tagging process and the way it interacts with the software .
0,other tagging problems result ( i think ) from the nomad 's operating system .
0,"also , i can 't understand why the software does not ignore "" the "" when it lists the cds in alphabetical order ."
0,"finally , making playlists from the computer can be complicated because the tracks are listed individually , and are organized by cd , which are not listed but are organized in alphabetical order ."
0,only thing missing from creative is a cd burner .
0,"the only thing i would complain about the zen xtra is that the controls are n 't as easy as the ipod 's , or as "" sexy "" looking ."
0,as mentioned in other reviews the headphones are useless and need to be replaced right away ! .
0,"the front cover ( which you remove to take out the battery ) feels flimsy but when snapped on , the device still feels pretty solid ."
0,"the scroll button is sort of annoying to push - a nice button would be nicer but eh , not a big deal ."
0,"it is slightly larger than an ipod , no doubt about it ."
0,i would have liked to have given it 4 1/2 stars docking that 1/2 star only for the size .
0,its far heavier and much larger which might not seem to matter except if you use it while running or keep it in your pocket .
0,"its far more difficult to select songs and has no easy to use on the fly playlist creation such as the new ipod not to mention it does n 't since with contact lists , phone numbers , address books , etc . like the ipod ( which eliminated my need for any kind of palm device ) ."
0,it also has unproven battery life .
0,"finally the software used to put all the songs into it is vastly inferior to itunes on two levels , first it is poorly integrated into the overall player and clunky to use especially with tagging and second the wma audio format sucks , flat out sucks in terms of sound quality compared with the vastly superior aac format the apple ipod uses and it sticks you with one of the sub par paid music services such as napster instead of allowing to use the itunes store , which , if you ever plan to pay for your music , is by far the best ."
0,* protective case completely useless as is since it obscures display window .
0,* scroll button more cumbersome than on earlier models .
0,* eax equalizer accentuates diminished quality of mp3 files .
0,"* does not provide enough volume when connected to larger headphones , or external receivers ( car radio ) ."
0,* software is absolutely terrible :
0,"-- > will not automatically transfer songs with identical titles ( if you have live albums or greatest hits albums , this will cause you inordinate frustration ) ."
0,"-- > does not recognize player at random times , despite being connected and displaying player 's library ."
0,-- > too difficult to change genre / album / track information for large number of tracks .
0,-- > you 'll be changing track information a lot because the cd database information utilized by the software is mediocre at best .
0,"my one issue with the mediasource software is that , despite pulling id3 tag data from the dds service , the ripping process fails to populate the "" year "" field ."
0,"navigation could be better , but there is n 't really anything the zen xtra can 't do once you 've gotten comfortable with it ."
0,"the only two things that stop me from giving it 5 stars are the ho-hum software that comes with the system , and the traveling case it comes with ."
0,"however , i do n 't like to carry it on my belt because the clip is n 't secure and the case can slip off ."
0,"also , the carrying case that came with mine covers up the display , so even though the side controls are reachable , i have to open it up to see the display ."
0,this player is an overall disappointment with a couple of big flaws that potential buyers should be wary of ; . and all readers need to know about a third party software company that resolves virtually all of the creative mediasource file transfer issues .
0,"1 . creative mediasource software is ok to rip , catalog & burn music if you are starting from scratch ; . but i used musicmatch to rip my cds before i bought the zen ( 278 cds ; . 3 , 400 tracks ; . 12 . 5 gb of music all ripped at 128bps ) and guess what ? ."
0,mediasource did not recognize my tags ! .
0,"2 . despite most reviewers giving kudos to the zen for music quality , i experienced a flaw using eax ."
0,"creative are * the * sound people for computers , i can 't understand why eax would introduce static ."
0,3 . mediasource is an application with serious user interface flaws .
0,"4 . the zen * stores * data files , but does not allow a folder structure nor does it allow documents to be opened or programs to be launched from its disk ( they must be copied to another hard drive to be launched ) ."
0,"in other words , the zen is not a convenient data storage device ; . only buy the capacity you need for your music collection ( see point 1 . for some sizing information ) ."
0,5 . the zen does not have a stop button ! .
0,but this is * not documented * in the zen manual - neither the hard copy nor the cd version .
0,"6 . the zen nx battery requires the ac adapter to recharge ; . it does not charge by usb cable ; . this is not tragic , but usb recharging would be a convenient ( additional ) choice ."
0,7 . mediasource did not install on my personal notebook .
0,the pc-side software can be goofy and takes a little getting used to but it 's not as bad as some reviewers have indicated .
0,they have a whole bunch of devices that all have the same-sounding name ( and they are long ) .
0,i just bought one and returned it as defective for good reason .
0,- the software that came with it was tough to load .
0,- the top that covered the battery kept poping off without much of a touch near the bottom latch .
0,the top did not fit well into the unit . ( felt defective )
0,- the cover that came with it did n 't fit very well
0,- the flywheel you use for most of the navigation was n 't in tightly and it was uneven as far as the amount of pressure to make it engage .
0,- this did not feel like quality construction and i was n 't sure how long it would last .
0,"the construction of the player is the cheesiest i have ever seen -- the front panel refused to clip in correctly , leaving a noticeable gap between the panel and base of the player ."
0,i 'm not willing to accept shoddy construction on something i paid over 250 dollars for .
0,i 've had this thing just over a month and the headphone jack has already come loose .
0,"i fully expect it to go bad again in the same or some other way in the next 6 months because , as other reviewers have pointed out , the construction is pretty flimsy ."
0,"like other reviewers , installation was hell ."
0,about 10 % of the time it can 't find the device when i attach it to my pc .
0,"after i had it a couple weeks , it got into a state where it could never find the device , no matter how often i rebooted my pc , reset the device , reloaded drivers , etc , etc . creative 's online support was no help at all ."
0,"in fact , i 'd have to rate it among the worst i 've ever encountered ."
0,"to my amazement , even that process was error-prone ."
0,"it took several days of attempts before things finally "" worked "" again and i have n 't a clue why ."
0,"my gut tells me the nomad will in the long run be , at best , a 40gb portable hard drive , albeit one on which i can 't create folders , or , at worst , a very expensive lesson in companies never to buy products from again ( i have their audigy sound card and find it in many ways equally frustrating ) ."
0,i will never buy a creative product again .
0,"i purchased a jukebox , it got fried while being recharged , they asked for $ 20usd just to look at it and said that they would charge me for reaping the damned thing ."
0,1 ) player is not plug and play - need to install nomad explorer first and mediasource to transfer files and i had to be patient as i was used to winxp detecting the player and dragging and dropping the music files into it .
0,"2 ) music organization is based on id3 ( by genre , artist , album , etc . ) and this can be a problem for older downloaded music files with missing or incorrect id3 information ."
0,3 ) folders can not be created for the audio files .
0,4 ) no fm or voice recording - these would have been nice extras .
0,5 ) lack of good accessories - this is more of an oversight of creative 's marketing .
0,6 ) the case occludes the display screen when it is closed .
0,not plug & play ; . relies on id3 ; . no fm or recording
0,"so , i 've had it for a month , and the headphone jack went out ."
0,nothing but hassle with this company .
0,the only thing i do n 't like about this is the cover does suck .
0,"it 's kinda heavy , kinda like having a walkman ."
0,"headphones suck , i would invest in some cool ones since it has the eax feature ."
0,the software sucks .
0,also the feature to automatically put in the song information is n 't always accurate .
0,"i 've had this thing for less than a month , treated it quite well , never dropped it , and the headphone jack is all screwed up ."
0,"kind of bulky and the wheel is awkward , but i can deal with that ."
0,"software definitely sucks , hangs up my notebook about half the time , but i do n 't mind buying notmad ."
0,i am annoyed that the player 's not automatically recognized as a hard drive .
0,"i loved it until it broke , but less than a month is not an acceptable period of time for something to work ."
0,i was willing to live with the larger size ( inconvenient on the road ) but the durability was a big zero .
0,always carried it in a case in by briefcase but one day the hard drive just zapped .
0,"i am disappointed and looking elsewhere for something that can withstand the "" rigor "" of a business traveler ."
0,"minor complaints : 1 ) even though the music is sorted via id3 tag on the player , the option to search for music contained in a folder is unavailable ."
0,"the zen xtra will transfer the files to the player , but not the folder name ."
0,"2 ) having unfilled id3 tags will cause music to be potentially placed in a folder called "" unknown . """
0,"3 ) with mediasource being so easy , i found no use for the bundled nomad explorer software ."
0,"in fact , it caused my system to hang more times than not , so i uninstalled it and stuck with mediasource 100 % ."
0,"first , the sound quality is okay , but ( as at least one other reviewer has mentioned ) the eax can cause audio interference after about 30 minutes ."
0,"second , the menu system and controls are poorly designed ."
0,the toggle button that is used to scroll is poorly designed and does not work well .
0,the general button placement is not very user friendly .
0,"third , the poor design continues with the case ."
0,my biggest complaint is the battery life or lack there of .
0,there is no way the battery supplied lasts 14 hours ! .
0,i 've also had the nomad zen lock-up several times .
0,the nomad zen could use a little sturdier construction like the archos jukeboxes or some kind of shock resistant case .
0,"at the very least , a sturdier more protective carrying case would be nice ."
0,"battery life is about 1/4 of that advertised , no operators manual available for any of the nomad zen players ( on or off-line ) , occasional software lockups , replacement battery is expensive"
0,"creative zen feedback suffers from construction quality , poor product support , difficulty of using the scroll wheel and reasonably consistent feedback about problems with the headphone jack ."
0,what is added in functionality ( battery replacement ) detracts in build quality as the face plate is prone to popping off .
0,"feedback on creative 's product support is universally poor ; . this is not limited to the zen , it applies to all the company 's products ."
0,the scroll wheel is finicky ; . it works most of the time but there is a learning curve for pressing it just right ; . new users say they have 50 % - 75 % success rate ; . some find it so frustrating that they just return the device .
0,the creative software is awkward / difficult to use and just plain does n 't load on some computers .
0,enough people have reported that their headphone jack does n 't work after a month of using the device to believe that creative has some inbuilt manufacturing or quality control problem .
0,"the zen does n 't support folders so it is not really a storage device ; . even with third party software that "" creates "" folders , documents and programs can 't be launched from the zen , so it is not a hard disk , it 's a storage device at best ."
0,"but with a low price , comes lower quality ."
0,the catch is it 's built like a piece of crap .
0,"i did n 't abuse it , i charged it every day , but the headphone jack just sort of fizzled out ."
0,"the software , mediasource , can not work on my pc . ( laptop , intel p4-2 . 0 , xp os ) ."
0,"in fact , each of my creative mp3 players had software problem in the first place ."
0,"the one and most major thing that i was disappointed with , in this player , is the battery life ."
0,the panel seems like it will come off very easily as other people have said .
0,you need the software to actually transfer files
0,"the player has its minor glitches like for example when i turn it on , 60 percent of the time , it sis , shutting down , which means i have to turn off , and turn it on again , which is not to my likings ."
0,"also , the player sometimes freezes , not a very big problem , but can also be annoying ."
0,yes the included earphones suck but everyone replaces them anyway .
0,creative software stinks .
0,the front cover can pop off easily but i always have mine in the case so i did n 't notice after first day .
0,"short warranty ( 3 months , so i got the extended warranty at best buy ) , occasional freeze up ( easily fixed by popping out battery ) , somewhat flimsy navigation wheel ."
0,"the only beef i can raise in this regard is the pop-off face , that sometimes comes off a bit easily , but besides that it 's perfect ."
0,the only thing missing is an option to adjust the balance .
0,do n 't buy this player .
0,"unfortunately , after loading 280 + songs , all i get now is "" player either not connected or busy . """
0,do n 't buy this player .
0,do not buy this product --
0,i took perfect care of this player and still it died in the week after the lousy 90 day warranty ended .
0,"the software is not good either and the driver has trouble working with other sound blaster products , which is very dumb ."
0,"however , my hard drive did fail , and i have not dropped it once ."
0,what a junk .
0,every time nomad thinks the file is corrupt the os freezes .
0,"the controls are somewhat harder to use , and there are some oddities about the software tagging system , but most people can live with this ."
0,"typically , the problem is the headphone jack -- it was for me and many others ."
0,"i 'm convinced by my own experience and that of many other people who have posted here who have had the same experience that the product is defectively designed , and will not hold up to normal use ."
0,the headphone jack seems to be a major problem .
0,"the one other thing i observed while i had the nomad is that the front cover , which is taken off to have access to the battery , seemed to come undone very easily ."
0,the headphone jack failure seems to occur just about when the warranty period is to expire .
0,"the other day when i was listening to a song , it locked up and will not do anything now ."
0,in that model the hard drive just died one morning before my class .
0,now it will start smelling if you leave it with diapers in it for an extended period but all of them will ! .
0,"the cons , at times the diaper wipes get stuck in the disposal area making it hard to turn the handle back and forth ."
0,"in addition , i don 't believe that it is odorless ."
0,my daughter is only 4 months old and we do notice an odor .
0,even with newborn diapers it filled way too fast .
0,it seemed as if we were emoting the pail everyday and it was in no way odorless .
0,the diaper genie needs it 's own refill bags in order to work and that 's just more money that you don 't have to spend .
0,"i find the major problem with this item is that if you have a very messy diaper and can 't tightly bundle it without a mess , the mess gets all over the module that dumps the diaper and the stink is outside of the diaper pail ."
0,my main complaints are that it should be deeper or wider as it doesn 't even fit a smaller sized garbage bag .
0,the hole to put the diaper in needs to be larger as i am now using medium diapers ( i have a 3 month old ) and they 're on the brink of being too large to fit no matter how compact i make then and how un-soiled they are .
0,i have noticed an odor ( one the i expected ! . ) when unloading the diaper champ but at least you don 't smell anything every time you use it .
0,for my first i had a diaper genie which was not only costly with the refills but it was also very stinky .
0,"but , sometimes , if the champ is too full , the flip handle won 't function ."
0,"( i never know when the champ is full as there is no way too tell . even though not particularly aesthetic , how about making the champ clear and see-through ? . ) so , i lift the lid and find a wad of diaper , which i must remove , usually stuck inside the lid itself because the bag is too full ."
0,opening the champ to empty out the bag is a little tricky- i pinched my thumb a few times before i got the hang of it .
0,"as one other reviewer pointed out , it does occasionally take a little effort to push down the "" plunger "" to get the diapers in the pail , even though upon inspection the bag doesn 't really look full ."
0,"the opening could be a little wider , i suppose , but i haven 't really seen anything else that could be improved ."
0,solid food poop is very stinky and this diaper pail doesn 't really contain the smell .
0,"i still like it a lot and am not changing it for another , but it is sort of stinky ."
0,i just wished that it didn 't fill up so fast ! .
0,but now that she is eating solids the odor is escaping out and we are constantly using freshener .
0,but be prepared to buy something else ( diaper genie ? . ) which can trap the odor better .
0,the other pail i used started to smell after 2 weeks of use .
0,"we found that when you put a dirty diaper into the top loader , there was a tendency to get streaks which would then get on the plunger which would then have to get cleaned each time it was used ."
0,we resorted to using small plastic bags to store the dirty diapers and dumping them in a trash can and using the diaper champ for wet diapers only .
0,we also had a problem with diaper wipes getting caught when the top was flipped .
0,it can be frustrating and messy when you put that last diaper in before realizing the unit is full .
0,the plug er gets stuck & you have to manually extract the mess .
0,"i registered for this item because of the good reviews it got , however i was not impressed ."
0,"for one thing , the diapers always get jammed in it ."
0,the product also leaves a faint smell in the room .
0,"all in all , the diaper champ serves its purpose , but it does not live up to its good reviews ."
0,too costly and not efficient if you ask me ! .
0,2 . you still have to clean the thing ! . ! .
0,"also , for those that complain that the diaper champ isn 't as effective as time passes , keep the following in mind : as babies get older , their diets changes ( aka solid foods ! . ) and so does the smell of their diapers ! ."
0,the only downside to this is that it can get pretty stinky long before the pail is full .
0,"i wash ours out with lysol each time i empty it , and that helps , but when its hot out- well , just be prepared ."
0,"that 's when it went from oder less , to odorous ! ."
0,it still smelled .
0,then it started to smell whether there were diapers in it or not .
0,cons - difficult to open to change bag-twice my bags caught on a sharp edge inside and snagged as i was pulling out-leaving dirty diapers all over the floor .
0,"also , diapers tend to stay in the middle , causing the pail to get backed up ."
0,diapers can get stuck when turned around if you don 't tightly wrap them first .
0,the only problem i have is with the handle you use to open the top compartment .
0,the way you have to shove your fingers under it and pull is just too tight .
0,i can 't tell you how many times i 've chipped a nail or hurt my fingertips because of the force needed to open it .
0,i had never liked the idea of the diaper genie because of the refills .
0,"gets stinky after a few months , the seal on the piston doesn 't seal anymore ."
0,"also , diapers and wipes get stuck in the grove below the piston ."
0,i gave up and got a diaper decor .
0,also much less stinky .
0,don 't buy the diaper champ .
0,"yes , you may get a whiff of a smell when you flip the handle , but then it is gone ."
0,to eliminate any smells we simple stuck a stick up room deodorizer inside the lid .
0,"the adjustment knob seemed ok , but when lowering the router , i have to practically pull it down while turning the knob ."
0,the collet for the 1/4 inch bits is a pain to get in and even harder to get out .
0,"then the most disappointing was trying to use viper raised panel bits that just barely fit , and i mean just barely ."
0,"however , it is much bigger , bulkier , and heavier than my other router and i would not like to use it freehand ( i keep it mounted in a table ) ."
0,"otherwise , get a smaller single speed router , which will be much easier to use freehand and is all you need for smaller diameter bits ."
0,"if you think you are saving $40 getting the hitachi , you are right , and you are also getting a router worth $40 less than a makita ."
0,it ain 't cutting edge ( no pun intended ) state of the art with all the latest bells & whistles & it definitely ain 't pretty .
0,i built my own router table with a tilt up top & made a hand crank to replace the height adjustment knob & these two things make it easy to change out & raise or lower the bits .
0,"it 's not the heaviest around ( i think porter-cable has that distinction ) , but i found its combination of weight and power really too much to allow precise handheld operation ."
0,"with the plunge lift all my bit changing has been done above the table , although i still have to reach below the table to operate the spindle lock ( and , of course , the speed and on/off controls ) ."
0,"not so nice things : - a bit too much weight and power for easy handheld use - spindle lock makes for awkward bit changing ( outside of a table ) - the 1/4 "" chuck sleeve requires much tightening to keep bits from slipping"
0,"the only complaint i have is that the 1/4 "" collet will not sufficiently hold any of my 1/4 "" bits ."
0,the hitachi collet simply was not ground accurately .
0,the plunge action isn 't smooth unless you make it so .
0,the instructions would benefit from some improvement and it would help if the rp ms of the speed settings were mentioned .
0,"also , the fit and finish could be better although this doesn 't detract from performance ."
0,the only problem i find with it is that the plunge mechanism will eventually stick due to wood dust .
0,i find that if you remove the springs it is much easier to adjust and will not stick much .
0,1 . your hitachi might come to you with a stiff spring mechanism .
0,"mine was so bad i had to to use a hammer to free it ( and this is why i 'm giving it 4 , not 5 stars ) ."
0,"i have noted that as you use the tool , sawdust builds in the channel and it requires attention ."
0,"not a killer problem , but not well done , either ."
0,the only beef that i have with it is that there is a little too much slop in the columns when the lock is not engaged .
0,if it weren 't so big i would probably by another since no shop is complete without a handful of routers . .
0,i did have to cut off the ears that hold the template guide in place so i could get those big panel raising bits in it .
0,i also removed the springs in the plunge tubes to make it easier to raise .
0,"i added a crank for those times when i need to make fine adjustments , but i seldom use it ."
0,i also put a bend in the wrench so i can remove and install bits from the top of the table .
0,"that said , i am disappointed in the plunging mechanism ."
0,"shortly after i brought it , the plunging shafts started sticking ."
0,"after repeal cleaning and re cleaning , it still stuck after using it for a little while ."
0,"i no longer use it as a plunge router , only as a stationary or table mounted router ."
0,"if the plunging action is critical to your work , look elsewhere ."
0,"it 's oftentimes hard to get a good grip on the router , activate the chuck lock , and get enough muscle behind the wrench to get the collet loosened up ."
0,i was some what sceptically when i seen the price deference between the other makers of comparable hp .
0,this router was a huge disappointment .
0,the depth adjustment was sloppy .
0,the speed control is recessed too far in the housing and required a tool ( screwdriver or dowel rod ) to effect any speed change .
0,it was impossible to change the speed with just my fingers .
0,my son tried it and he too couldn 't change the speed without an assist .
0,"i sent it back , as i think that the speed control is either poorly designed or defective ."
0,"all in all , not very good ."
0,"the only not-so-positive comment i have is about the depth adjustment , it is not easy to micro-adjust accurately ."
0,"the major reasons i didn 't give it a five are : one , i didn 't think the fine adjustment worked well ."
0,i replaced it with a router raiser and it works much better .
0,"two , the single wrench just doesn 't work well ."
0,the sliding latch is does not stay in place .
0,the fine adjustment knob which came with the router was very difficult to use on a router table .
0,"finally , i gave up and i purchased a router racier ."
0,"i am seriously considering purchasing another wrench and just not using the "" sliding wrench "" which comes on the router ."
0,"it it is a bit heavy for hand held work , but any router this size will be ."
0,recently the variable speed control went out .
0,it would work fine for a while then as the motor warmed up it would die .
0,"the only other problem with this router that i have encountered is the plunge action will start to stick , then it needs to be cleaned and lubricated ."
0,only problem is that is a bit heavy .
0,they last about 1 1/2 years until the problems start .
0,my first router is a safety hazard if you do not pay attention and are not very careful .
0,"luckily the soft start helped before it took the wood and tossed it or worse case , a finger ."
0,"once a depth is locked , it will jump off a little while working ."
0,you must keep double checking depths .
0,"well , my second one is now beginning to hi cup a bit after about 1 1/2 years ."
0,the electronic speed control is not doing it 's job and the router begins to speed up and slow down at will .
0,"if this machine just stops on you , unplug it quickly and get out of the way ! ."
0,the wizard is particularly sinister .
0,"it just tells you to start disconnecting and attaching cables without any input as to whether your current setup includes a pre-existing router ( mine does ) , without any clarity as to whether you should be running the wizard on a hard-wired pc or a wireless equipped pc ."
0,"the box proudly displays "" securest ( tm ) "" "" wireless made simple "" "" one touch setup button "" "" easy start "" "" easy security "" "" easy everyday "" apparently linksys/cisco knows that ease of setup is crucial ."
0,"however , configuration of my system and actual setup of the router for wireless use took me more than 3 hours , and briefly made me reconsider my choice to for ego the airport and its notoriously easy setup ."
0,too bad they don 't mention anything about how the cd can 't be used with a mac .
0,i even downloaded the product 's user manual - useless .
0,the linksys technical support site has nothing about configuring the router for use with a mac .
0,"i say adequate because it was enough to get wireless working , but nowhere near enough instruction to do the proper configuration job that i could have done if so ! ."
0,what this product really needs is better documentation for how to set up the router for different operating systems ! .
0,* i 'm giving it 4 stars because the setup process was so miserable .
0,i had some issues when i had enabled wep encryption and then moved on to wpa .
0,linksys is more costlier than others and is a home/consumer division of disco .
0,"there were no other obvious setup instructions - though there was a soft copy manual , it did not give an answer readily on what do to ."
0,the only other problem was that security for the wireless connection .
0,"little to no networking experience , just in case the automatic cd method has issues ."
0,this is not an enterprise piece of hardware that you will find in an office or corporate environment .
0,the new hardware version does not run linux at all and most likely will not since the memory has been cut in half .
0,i tried the cd setup program without any luck .
0,"essentially , the cd included with the package is , for the most part , worthless ."
0,"however , this product performed well below my expectation ."
0,"the achilles heel of this router is its inability to stream music , or copy large files over the local network ."
0,"after some research on the net , i discovered that there is indeed a flaw with the current wrt54g design ( wrt54g , version 3 , which amazon currently sells ) ."
0,it is not reliable .
0,a couple of times a week it seems to cease access to the internet .
0,"that is , you can not access the internet at all ."
0,very annoying .
0,the installation software cd crashed repeatedly .
0,"i then tried to set up the router through linksys 's browser interface , but as the only instructions available tell you to use the installation cd , i had little luck - i did manage to connect briefly , but the connection kept dropping , and with no idea of how to resolve that issue , i gave up ."
0,i couldn 't get the install wizard to work .
0,knocked 1 star off for the install wizard - it wasted alot of time running it .
0,"it took me three days , to the tune of neil young 's song "" piece of cr -- ! . "" , to get this to work with the satellite hookup i was hired to connect this wireless network up to ."
0,"there is not a word about satellite issues in either the user guide or the "" knowledge "" database at linksys . com , and first tech support person i spoke with kept me on the phone for an hour , then gave me a web site address to consult -- that turned out to be the one i 'd already found during a search of my own ."
0,i was having intermittent problems with it losing connection .
0,"i 'd recommend this is you want to wireless network your laptop , but if you want to wirelessly network a couple desktops together you might want to wait until linksys improves their desktop software/hardware ."
0,"unfortunately , linksys does not write the best documentation ."
0,i tried to do this by instinct and it 's not intuitive unless you are a network geek .
0,"i had a lot of problems setting it up , since the software given along with it is buggy ."
0,"the firmware has bugs too , so download and install the latest firmware from linksys ."
0,the instant setup button in the front of the router messes up the network it is better to configure the router manually .
0,"this is not a router i would suggest for a novice user , my old dlink di52 ! ."
0,the internet connection would go down every 5 mins when i used it with a p2p program called bit spirit .
0,so-so 1 . customer service - 6 calls half were efficient other half were equally incompetent .
0," "
0,both of them keep disconnecting on me and interruptions are 3 or 4 times per day at best .
0,stay away from this junk .
0,was a bit wary because the software is windows only and i have an mac .
0,the downside being that the tito can only connect at 802 . 11b speeds and not 802 . 11g .
0,"( . . . ) like most soho routers , it has nearly non-existant logging ."
0,now this router is not the cheapest on the market .
0,"even the pdf manual that comes with it is pretty vague for someone not familiar with "" mac settings "" , etc ."
0,we bought this about 6 months ago and it 's been worthless .
0,it constantly drops the internet connection and simple things like walls in our house block the link so everything is very slow .
0,the tech support is worthless too .
0,"unfortunately , creative offered scant few pages of instruction , which meant that i was on own from the outset ."
0,"after attempting to navigate the clumsy touch-pad system , i could not get the unit to download my wma files ."
0,"so , you might inquire , why don 't they make it a first priority to carefully , simply explain how download music from your music library to their device ? . ? . ? . this seems academic to me ."
0,"most of us just want to plug and play , not spend a year navigating a maze of complicated options . . . like transfering everything on a hard drive to this stupid thing ."
0,"unfortunately , the touch-pad issues [non-intuitive] and poor instruction guide killed it ."
0,this one is particularly bothersome : allegedly one can use the zen micro as a portable drive to store and transport data from one computer to another .
0,"who wants to go through the hassles of loading software onto a "" foreign "" computer just to move over some simple ( * . txt ) files ? ."
0,") button sensitivity : even reduced to the lowest sensitivity setting , the buttons are far two sensitive , really takes some getting use to , and even then , it is still too sensitive ."
0,") worst feature possible , this alone makes it rate one star : what 's up with no recharge cord ? ."
0,you have to purchase that separately for some outrageous cost .
0,"i took my zen micro with me over the weekend , and was forced to lug my laptop with me on the trip for one reason : to keep the zen micro charged ."
0,i have trashed this product on other opinion sites based on this major flaw alone .
0,") creative , inc . the maker includes the barest of the bare minimum in the box , then through gross profiteering nickles and dimes you on every single accessory at extraordinarily inflated prices ."
0,"the box included a little polyester , pull-string bag , ( yes , you read right a bag , something a boy would carry ten marbles in ) and tries to pass it off as the case ."
0,"if you want to purchase a real case or container or clip-on carrier for you zen micro , expect to purchase it separately and to dish out big time . ."
0,"iriver has a better fm receiver built in , but the drawback to iriver products is they are flimsy and poorly constructed ."
0,"as i wrote , this could have been a great product , but expect hidden charges ( read gross profiteering and price gouging ) as the company royally sticks you on every conceivable accessory necessary for normal daily usage ."
0,"the touchpad is annoying sometimes ( give me the click-wheel and pres sable buttons any day ) , but not at all as difficult to get over as other people are saying ."
0,and supply those stupid white headphones .
0,the touch pad does take a little getting used to .
0,the touch controls took a little getting used to but now i wouldn 't change it for the scroll wheel .
0,"software the software that comes along with it is not very intuitive but once you are used to it , it does the job well ."
0,there are 2 things that need fixing first is the battery life . it will run for 6 hrs without problems with medium usage of the buttons .
0,"second might be a problem i might have with my pc but not too sure , when the player is connected on the usb and i start playing on it and also using the windows explorer , it sometimes pauses by itself and tries to synchronize with the pc during play , which is a bit irritating ."
0,"however after just one month my headphone jack was broken as a result of normal , every-day use ."
0,"i dont especially like how music files are unstructured ; . basically they are just dumped into one folder with no organization , like you might have in windows explorer folders and sub folders ."
0,"the headphones are not very comfortable , but most people have a certain style they like so just go buy new ones or keep the ones you have ."
0,"the creative mediasource software that comes with the zen micro is cluttered , and excludes my favorite feature in itunes , the ability to automatically copy everything you import into a certain folder ."
0,negatives of the player itself : you need to do a little work before having full enjoyment of this player .
0,"even on the low sensitive level , a slight touch can skip or pause the track ."
0,this fixes some glitches such as the player freezing .
0,first thing i noticed was that the creative wasn 't well made .
0,"one drop from a pocket or desktop , and it 'd be a goner ."
0,"problems with the sound quality were evident right away , but even i couldn 't imagine they 'd be that bad ."
0,"the eq is awful , and even at top volumes , the bass is flat sounding ."
0,cranking the master volume level up past the mark of the bar only leads to distortion and compromised sound quality .
0,"the headphone jack gave out after only a couple weeks of use , and the stock earbuds were replaced same day with some high end sony 's i 'd been having ."
0,"if you 've been listening to cd 's in your car for awhile , dealing with the drop-off in sound quality may take some getting used to ."
0,"even after all the nightmare sound problems , i 'd still half-way like this product if it kept it 's promise ; . the ability to store 1500 songs ."
0,"i got about 700 loaded up before it told me i was full , and at that point , i was ready to toss it out the window ."
0,"my friend has an ipod , and although the sound quality probably won 't meet most audiophile standards , the product itself is better than anything creative has made ."
0,"the only reason for not giving it 5 stars : the claimed battery life of 12 hours is very optimistic - possible maybe if you really sit down and listen continuously for 12 hours without ever touching the player , but in real life i can probably get 6-8 hours at most ."
0,"even the "" shorter "" battery life , though , has not impaired my positive experience with the zen micro in any way ."
0,limitations : - not a lot of original accessories like the ipod .
0,- the battery life leaves a lot to be desired .
0,"i downloaded the new firmware which was supposed to take care of the problem , but it hasn 't worked ."
0,"- the outlook syn ch only works for non recurring appointments , which personally is very annoying to me but probably wont be to most people . -"
0,i occasionally flip songs while working out as i accidently hit the pad even lightly ( yes i have it in maximum desensitized mode ) .
0,- not compatible with audible . com books .
0,"overall , it does its basic function very well , but we expect more from the mp3 players today and the zen micro does not rise to the occasion ."
0,pc software that comes with the player is not as simple as i tunes but its not bad at all .
0,the scroll bar again takes some getting used to .
0,since zen does not have an external antenna it has some problems catching weak signals but it works .
0,i dont use the belt clip cz it fails to hold the player securely ( design problem ) .
0,"what i dont like : nothing much except headphones , belt clip design ."
0,"p . s . the only snag i encountered while initially configuring the device was trying to hook up the micro to a front usb port . the bus for the front port on my motherboard did not have enough power ; . after connecting it to the rear ports , it works perfectly ."
0,"the ipod mini is smaller and sexier , albeit limited in supported formats and the rio karma is a far better value ."
0,"the karma is only $5 more , it 's small , had a 20 gig drive and supports more formats including gog ."
0,the karma doesn 't look as sexy but it 's interface is very efficiently designed .
0,after a week i tried to load some more songs and delete a few but the auto load didn 't do anything but turn on my player .
0,it seems like the software is just not responding .
0,"the support has been less than impressive , considering the cost ."
0,"i 'm going to try to get a refund but considering all the hoops i jumped through ( emails , downloads , reboots , a purge and another download , plus reading through the help menu ) a refund should be twice as frustrating ."
0,"while the software may not be as easy as i-tunes , it is not difficult to use by any stretch ."
0,"if i was pressed to find a negative aspect of the zen micro i would probably have to mention weak fm reception , but the building where i primarily use the micro seems to have a history of terrible radio reception anyway , so you can take that for what it 's worth ."
0,"it had issues right off the bat , with freezing up , staying in 'shutting down ' mode , and just not functioning very well in general ."
0,"the touch-pad would be a great thing if it worked well , and as i never had issues getting songs transferred to the player , i did have problems accessing them from the player ."
0,many other reviewers are mentioning that they have had no problems at all> i would say that the main problem is that this player is just not made very well .
0,"it is the 'first generation ' of the player , and while i still agree that it is a great alternative to the ipod , i think there are many others that would be a much better value for your buck ."
0,"if someone asked me flat out , i 'd say to go woth something else ."
0,"i 've since replaced it with a pair of black sennheisers . . . not only are the packaged earbuds pretty uncomfortable , but are too similar to ipod 's and can target ipod thieves here in nyc ."
0,"although , i thought it could 've been designed a bit better ."
0,it 's perfect for those who aren 't planning on storing tons of music .
0,"weak points : - touch pad : design could be better - volume control : controlled through the vertical strip , but purchasing a headphone with built-in volume control will do the trick ."
0,- radio quality : weak reception
0,"the colors are a joke , and i personally hate the stupid vertical touchpad ."
0,but my biggest gripe is still the extremely ugly design .
0,still has terrible software .
0,you have to wonder why creative can 't get this right .
0,screen review could be better .
0,apple still does it better but needs to come out with a 5 gig mini .
0,"the touch buttons do take a little getting used to and i don 't like how the scroll button is the same button used as an "" enter "" key , but you get used to it and it isn 't a big deal ."
0,"the fm radio 's reception isn 't spectacular , but it will pick up the most powerful stations in any given metro area ."
0,"00% good though , and the zen does have a few drawbacks ."
0,"while transferring songs to the player , the interface has crashed a few times ( 4-5 times in a 4-5 hour period ) normally this would cause me major concern , but it appears that this bug is reproducible , which leads me to believe that creative will fix it with a patched version shortly ( or maybe it 's just my computer ) ."
0,another thing i don 't like is that some of the features take 1-2 seconds to load up .
0,"after consulting with creative 's customer support , they determined that the hard drive was broken and the only recourse was to send it in for repair , which would cost me $40 , since it 's past the 90 day warranty ( pretty short warranty ) ."
0,"well , i got my second player , and right out of the box it wasn 't working right and once again , after consulting customer se ! ."
0,they obviously have quality and reliability problems .
0,"they have a good concept here , and i normally expect a lot better quality from creative , so maybe they will do better with the next gen version , but for now i say buyer beware ."
0,"es , the interface took a little getting used to , but once i did , it 's almost second nature now ."
0,only slight negatives i 've had so far is that i haven 't been able to get it to accept any of my wav files yet .
0,my other nit is that it didn 't include at least some kind of carrying case for everything .
0,"yes , there is a belt clip , but that doesn 't hold the extra battery and usb cable ."
0,the little bag it comes with is cheap and useless .
0,"it barely holds anything and mine just puts a bunch of thread fuzzes all over the player , because the bag is cheap and seems to be coming apart ."
0,it is not a perfect product but it does have a lot going for it .
0,"on the downside , i think the interface takes some getting used to and the zen software ! ."
0,is not as intuitive as i would like .
0,"also , the earbuds that came with it sound great but are uncomfortable ( although my wife didn 't have a problem ) , so i bought a pair of over-the-ear headphones ."
0,"the touch pad is over-sensitive , and is adjustable to only slightly oversensitive ."
0,"the machine itself seems fine , but the software that came with it is awful ."
0,"after installation , the very first time i booted up the creative mediasource organizer , intending to use its cd burning and ripping functions , it totally shorted out ."
0,"i was up all night trying to make the stupid thing work , to no avail ."
0,"of course one of the first things i did was write an email to the customer support at creative , through their website , and by the time they finally got back to me - several working days later when they promise only one - their suggestions were completely worthless ."
0,his is what i get for my $200 on this mp3 player ? .
0,it wouldn 't always work seamlessly with wmp and it often required me to restart the frozen micro by taking out the battery and restarting it .
0,"as for the zen micro : \ cons : i read that every button is touch sensitive , and thats very annoying when all the main buttons are on the front ."
0,"putting the micro into your pocket could trigger just about anything ( unless the hold feature is improved : it asks if you want to "" unholy "" for every button up press ) second , i 'm worried about the durability of the player ."
0,"after research of other creative hard drive players , i found that most of them aren 't very durable and tend to crash ( read most reviews on amazon . com and see for yourself ) ."
0,"last , i find the price a bit expensive for a product such as this ."
0,"verdict : had i not needed something with a tad bit more space , i consider this player fair game ."
0,it does take some getting used to .
0,whatever . . . on to the negatives : -touchy about charging . . . you can damage the battery and seriously decrease it 's life if you don 't upgrade the firmware or dont ' heed the advice to always plug in the player side of the cord before plugging in the outlet side .
0,it has the odd side effect of the buttons only partially working ? .
0,-user 's guide doesn 't cover a lot of important info that is covered on their website .
0,) -can 't be left in the car . . . it immediately shuts down with an overheating error if left in a hot car for too long .
0,"i tried to use the fm radio option , but it doesn 't seem to really pick up the stations i listen , however i am going to try it in a different location , it may have just been my residential location ."
0,"even when i set it to low , it 's still very hard for me to adjust the player to where and what i want it to do ."
0,"i 've read about the issues with the scroll bar , but they must have taken care of that now ."
0,the touchpad is virtually unusable -- sometimes you have to press like mad to make a selection and other times the slightest brush causes something to be selected that you don 't want .
0,"another problem is that the latest 2 . 0 firmware upgrade moves you into windows media player 10 which seems to be very , very slow for downloads . charging[-2]"
0,"if you buying this player to use with napster to go , wait a while ."
0,a lot of people are having problems with the firmware update required to use the player for napster to go . . the firmware is beta and they are are a lot of bugs in it .
0,"imagine my disappointment , though , when the zen micro proved able to play only the mega-strongest fm signals in my area ."
0,it seems like you need to park yourself right next to a radio tower for the micro to pull in a strong sound .
0,"the battery , as others have said , also seems weaker than creative suggests ."
0,"still , that 's enough time that i 'm still satisfied , if a bit grouchy with creative 's over hyped promises ."
0,"respectable , solid , but not awe-inspiring ."
0,where close to 12 hours but at least it is replaceable ( and they included a second one free ) .
0,"i would give it about 6 or 7 hours , although it will probably get better after a few charge cycles ."
0,"the headphones which came with it are mediocre at best but what can you expect from a set of "" ear buds "" ."
0,unfortunately i was wrong .
0,"within one month , my player completely died ."
0,"( it had locked up multiple times previously , but always managed to work after wards ) this time , the touch screen wouldn 't respond to me and none of the buttons worked ."
0,"so i took out the battery and put it back in again , only to find that it would not work ."
0,i had the second one for less than two weeks when i noticed a rattling/humming/buzzing sound while music was played .
0,i sent creative customer service 3 emails in which they did not help me one bit and don 't seem to even want to help .
0,"it 's too bad , though , that ! ."
0,"the included headphones suck , so get your own ."
0,"the touch sarene navigation will take a little getting used to , but once you do , and while the zen is still alive , it 's a great alternative to the marching in lock step with the click wheel commies ."
0,"just too numerous to list : fm radio , which has weak reception , but at least it there , and a microphone , to name just two ."
0,"but , the creative zen micro is plagued by a serious , serious stupid and elemenatary design flaw , and i 'm going to tell you what it is . . . but first , two more things about this piece of garbage that 's so great and could 've made it a potential ipod killer ."
0,"but , all of this means nothing , because of the serious , serious , stupid and ridiculously elemenatary design flaw : after 3 months , give or take a few weeks , you won 't be able to hear anything ."
0,"because the "" engineers "" at creative screwed up the design of the headphone jack ."
0,"again , the headphone jack on this thing is garbage ."
0,"again , this is a design flaw in the headphone ! ."
0,the flaw is inside the zen .
0,the flaw is in the circuit board that the headphone jack is connected to .
0,"the creative zen micro is a zen micro killer , not an ipod killer ."
0,why would anyone buy this when you can get a 20gb ipod that will hold 4 times the number of songs ( and even more if aac encoding is used ) for the same price ? . ? . ? .
0,"to use the creative zen player with a subscription service , you need to go to creative 's web site , and download new software for your pc ."
0,"i haven 't seen any problems yet , but if you don 't like to tinker a bit , this player can be a little challenging to set up ."
0,"right now , the creative software transfers subscription music files very slowly ."
0,this doesn 't affect standard mp3 files - just subscription wma files .
0,"the subscription files are still a little slower to transfer , but it 's only by about 10% or so ."
0,"again , this doesn 't affect regular mp3 files - just subscription drm-encoded files , like those from napster-to-go or yahoo music unlimited ."
0,"i don 't know , maybe i got a defective one but first , the player would not shut off , next , the player would not come on - i had to send it away to get repaired ."
0,"now , the player 's ear phone jack is not working - i have to send it away again ."
0,1 . pictures wo n 't transfer to pc directly from the camera using the included transfer cable .
0,. this camera keeps on outfoxing in auto mode with a buzzing sound which can 't be stopped .
0,. even the slightest of the shakes totally distorts your image
0,. images taken indoor were n 't so clear .
0,. lens cap is a really annoying
0,. the movie clips taken will always have some ' noise ' in it - you can 't avoid that .
0,"within a year , there are problems with my menu dial knob ."
0,"i send my camera to nikon for servicing , took them a whole 6 weeks to diagnose the problem ."
0,"got a "" system error "" problem 30 days after purchase ."
0,made the camera totally inoperable .
0,"also , the lens cap design is flawed ."
0,audio on video also lacking .
0,1 . pictures taken in an indoor setting are a little dull and rarely hazy if you tend to take photographs from a distance .
0,2 . it takes a while for the camera to actually capture the photograph from the time you click the button and i have seen people becoming a little impatient waiting for the flash to glow .
0,3 . the pictures come out hazy if your hands shake even for a moment during the entire process of taking a picture .
0,"focusing on a display rack about 20 feet away in a brightly lit room during day time , pictures produced by this camera were blurry and in a shade of orange ."
0,"the inside pics , can be a bit challenging , but when you can instantly delete pics you dont like , that are not focused perfectly , or need lighting adjustments , make this camera very simple and effective ."
0,the only things i have found that i havent liked is that the lcd is hard to read in daylight but everyone else's is too .
0,one downside though is that autofocus does not work well when battery is low .
0,"it comes with a rechargable battery that does not seem to last all that long , especially if you use the flash a lot ."
0,it does not have an auto-focus assist light which is nice for taking shots in low-light situations it allows the camera to focus in low light .
0,"it has a 3x optical zoom , which is average for these cameras ."
0,"the only drawbacks i 've encountered are : 1 indoor shots from a distance > 8ft lack contrast and color , but i 've found this to be a problem with all cameras with built-in flashes that i 've used even on a nikon slr ."
0,2 the battery life seems to be on the short side but adequate for most situations .
0,"3 the picture editing software it came with is adequate , but not very robust ."
0,"on average , indoor shots with a flash are not quite as good as 35mm ."
0,"i only have one complaint , and that is the 8mb card included ."
0,8mb for a camera like this is a joke .
0,1 no direct firewire to the camera .
0,"2 the camera is so small that when you attach some lenses i have the 19mm wide-angle -- wc-e 68 , the optical viewfinder is partially obscured ."
0,the only disappointment so far has been battery life .
0,mine generally requires a charge every 48 hours or so and i don 't really talk on it that much .
0,i purchased this phone knowing it was slightly old as compared to the newer models of nokia phones available .
0,i thought it was kind of steeply priced at that time .
0,"anyhow some demerits of this phone , the phone has a slow processor and the ear volume is lower than 6610 but then the 6610 has the best ear volume among most nokia variants ."
0,the battery life of this phone is at most 2 days and at least one day at excessive use .
0,video recording is limited at just 9 seconds .
0,you can upgrade but then there 's a certain level of trouble involved .
0,"i 've had nokia 's for years , and while this one is packed with whiz bang features it is disappointing for its primary use - a phone ."
0,"on the plus side it 's packed with features , including bluetooth that works fine - it 's really a tiny computer that is also a phone . . . and that 's the negative ."
0,"as a computer , or pda its weak since the screen , while large by phone standards , is still tiny to really do anything on ."
0,"when you dial a number , you 'll need to check the screen to see that the number entered is correct ."
0,you 'll do that because the keys are tightly packed in and your fingers will likely press two keys at once .
0,"i hope you have a magnifying glass , because the number displayed as well as most of the pop up options are tiny ."
0,it 's as though nokia has segregated 90% of the screen for fancy features rarely used and leave just 10% for the day to day use .
0,"i 've have many nokia 's and while this is the best for features , it 's the worst as a phone ."
0,"my old siemens s56 , on the other hand , worked beautifully with all of the above ."
0,who in the hell needs a frigging *vga* camera on their cellphone ? . ? . ? .
0,"only thing i don 't like about it is slow in changing apps , boot up , and sometime it has problem connect thru bluetooth ."
0,"and , other else , the camera is still vga ."
0,"i must say , this one is quite slow to open an application ."
0,"sometimes , it needs few minutes to open an application ."
0,but not good enough for me .
0,"i have overall been disappointed with nokia in the past , finding that samsung and motorola tended to have better quality phones ."
0,the only problem is that occasionally the joystick does start to dig into your thumb while gaming .
0,"my biggest concern is that i have found nokia phones lower quality construction to lead to lower prices , but they also don 't last as long ."
0,"operation : it 's like bmw 's i-drive - it does it 's job , but has the most unintuitive , overly-layered interface ."
0,the phone must be shut down & taken apart to change the memory card . . . and turning the phone back on takes a little while .
0,even the instruction booklet is out of order .
0,"no matter how accustomed to the phone you become , too much time is required to get to , open and close applications ."
0,"the phone does not have an mp3-player , fm radio , 200k+ color screen , megapixel camera , quad band , pda , photo editor ."
0,"styling/ergonomics : the keys are small , which generally doesn 't bother me if they are spaced because i can employ a little 'braille , ' but the keys run into each other , so careful attn . must be paid when dialing ."
1,im a more happier person after discovering the i/p button ! .
1,"but , if you 're looking for my opinion of the apex dvd player , i love it ! ."
1,it practically plays almost everything you give it .
1,for the price it is a well spent investment ! .
1,"this is by far the nicest one , in so many ways ."
1,"it 's very sleek looking with a very good front panel button layout , and it has a great feature set ."
1,its fast-forward and rewind work much more smoothly and consistently than those of other models i 've had .
1,"it plays alternate video formats ( cads , svcds , cods ) very well ."
1,and amazon . com has it for such a great price -- how can you go wrong ? .
1,"what got me to buy was the reviewer that said it would play dvd-rs fill of files ( e . , mp3s ) ."
1,it sure does ! .
1,that 's a rare and valuable feature .
1,"another nice thing is that the unit has both optical and coax digital audio outputs , though the latter was not mentioned in the literature i 'd scanned before buying ."
1,"at double-speed ( 2x forward speed ) , it still plays mp3s with sound -- they are pitch-corrected and smooth , but twice as fast ! ."
1,"update : the finish is more "" mirror "" than silver -- and i like it ! ."
1,player works and looks great - if you can get the dvd 's to play .
1,"for the first few weeks , this player was everything i expected it to be , an affordable multi-format dvd player with a stylish slim case as advertised ."
1,i bought this apex 2600 dvd player for myself at christmas because it got good reviews as a good value for the money on a variety of different sites .
1,i took it to my father 's house to play a tom jones concert dvd and he loved the player so much i gave it to him .
1,have used it frequently and have had no problems .
1,i liked this one enough to buy another .
1,my dad also has an apex tv and it was another great value for the money .
1,great quality picture and features .
1,it looks great - and is loaded with features .
1,the apex 2600 has been a steady performer for me .
1,"i bought mine in december of 2003 , and have had no real problems with it ."
1,"( he had owned two apex dvd players , and was pleased with both of them . )"
1,"the fact that this model would play jpeg slide shows was a big plus for me as a visual artist , and i discovered by accident ( it is not mentioned anywhere in the literature ) that it will play mpeg1 files on a regular cd-r data disk without vcd formatting ."
1,"while i would like to give it 3 . 5 stars instead of 4 , i gave it a 4 because it has run well for me during the time i have owned it ."
1,"nothing has broken on it , and it plays all the dvds i have ."
1,we tried it out christmas night and it worked great .
1,even viewed cds full of jogs .
1,"well , it was nice while it lasted ."
1,"this dvd player plays raw mpeg2 and mpeg1 videos , jpeg , wma , cmdr / cadre / dvd / dvd , and of course plays dvd movies from uk . i love the giff , progressive scan feature ."
1,"because of it 's hidden features ( no macro vision , non-regional ) i keep this baby around to watch non-american region dvd 's ."
1,"the cool thing about the ad-2600 it plays alot of different file like mp3 , wma cds , jpeg and kodak picture cds , dvd 's , dvd - / + r 's ."
1,"it 's not a listed feature but , the one thing that sold the unit is that it plays mpeg video ."
1,i find this to be a great feature .
1,i 've tried playing all of these discs and they all play great .
1,for the money apex machines have good features .
1,"it 's low profile , space saving design looks nice ."
1,i find the apex ad-2600 to be a great buy .
1,"i was surprised to find that not only could this dvd player play mpeg2 format which allowed me to stack 2 movies on a dvd , but it also was able to play vb files which i created with smart ripper ."
1,the af feature did a great job converting the letterbox to fill 3/4 of the screen and the image still looked normal .
1,loved the slim design .
1,audio is excellent .
1,i am very pleased with the apex ad2600 . it plays just about anything you put in the drawer .
1,"but , it seems to work so well now , that i do n 't anticipate any problems with it ."
1,simple to use and hook up .
1,the progressive scan option can be turned off easily by a button on the remote control which is one of the simplest and easiest remote controls i have ever seen or used .
1,this is the best dvd player i 've purchased .
1,"this player has worked flawlessly for me and at this price , you can 't go wrong ."
1,"well , this apex dvd player turned out great ! ."
1,"it plays basically every media i 've tested so far , even an old vcd that i ripped years ago and the rental dvd that could n 't be played on my old $ 200 sharp player ! ."
1,"i have to say i 'm also pretty impressed by the user interface for playing jpeg , mp3 and mpeg files stored on cd-rs / dvds ."
1,i did not want to have high expectations for this apex player because of the price but it is definitely working out much better than what i would expect from an expensive high-end player .
1,and the slim form-factor together with the mirror-like front panel sure makes the player look cool and pricey ! .
1,"finally , amazon 's free shipping is really getting good , it took only 3 working days for the player to reach me ! ."
1,for the most part this is a good dvd player .
1,we are overall pleased with product .
1,"progressive scan player for a relatively low price ( although the better known manufacturers like toshiba , pioneer , and panasonic are now offering lower-priced progressive scan players as well ) ."
1,"seems to read most dvds fine , and reads quietly ( i had a pioneer player that had fairly loud disc spin noise ) ."
1,"also , i have not had trouble reading svcds that i created and br mp3 cds ( my old apex ad-1200 had trouble with these ) ."
1,"output through component connections looks very good , on my non-hd tv ."
1,"i checked out the amazon reviews and i 'm pleased to say mine worked , works , fine right out of the box ."
1,i like the auto fit feature = you can stretch wide screen dvd 's to normal .
1,looks ok - very shiny chrome and mirrors .
1,this thing plays everything i feed it .
1,when i 1st tried it i found that it had no problem playing the more expensive dvd - r media disc 's that other players would play but to my surprise was able to play cheep media that i had burned that i could n 't get to work before in anything but the dvd burner itself that i had made the disc with .
1,"easy to use , small form factor , and looks good to boot ."
1,it does n 't smell like burning plastic when you open the drive .
1,without a doubt the finest looking apex dvd player that i 've seen .
1,"excellent picture quality - on par with my pioneer , panasonic , and jv players ."
1,"remote : you can stand it on end ( harder to lose ) , and it 's far better designed than the 1100s ."
1,"unlike some of the other people who received a "" lemon "" , my dvd player came in perfect working condition ."
1,"as a whole , the dvd player has a sleek design and works fine ."
1,this player seems to work fine with everything else .
1,it 's running great for all the dvds i have and rented .
1,apex ad-2600 runs all the dvd media including dvd + r/rw and dvd-r / rw ( unlike sony or panasonic - one supports only + r/rw and another supports - r/rw ) .
1,"i think , apex is the best dvd player you can get for the price ."
1,most of them are already switched to apex and they are happy .
1,this has so many capabilities that you 'll always have room for new technologies as they evolve .
1,"i use this with a home theater system and it 's amazing how it sounds , the picture clarity is unmatched ! ."
1,so much packed in a small case and very affordable ! .
1,"it 's a compact , attractive machine and was easy to set up ."
1,"basic usage is easy , but the remote has a lot of buttons that i have n 't used ."
1,"so far , we 've only used this player a few times to watch movies and it has worked fine ."
1,"the picture is clear , bright and sharp and the sound is good ."
1,"it works well enough ( so far ) for me to be satisfied with it , and it 's possible that i 'm missing something ."
1,i 'm giving this player cautious recommendation .
1,there are a lot of things i like about it .
1,received apex dvd and the picture was great when set up with s connector .
1,so far the dvd works so i hope it does n 't break down like the reviews i 've read .
1,amazon was wonderful about picking it up the next day and paying for the return shipping .
1,retraction : said mine had silver plate : it does have display .
1,it works great .
1,"the unit seems to play all formats that i have put in it ( jpeg , kodak pic 's and dvd-r ) i have read other reviews and some good and so om not so good , but my feeling at this time is "" two thumbs up "" ! ."
1,"it seems to be working fine , but we 've not used it all that much ."
1,"the player looked good right out of the box , offering lots of features and good styling ."
1,amazon is awesome ! .
1,"for the price , it 's a very nice dvd player ."
1,it does play a wide range of formats as advertised which is very nice .
1,and so far have not had any problems with dvds not being able to play .
1,i only wanted something to play dvds on but this machine has all these other features that i probably will never use but it 's nice to know that there 're there .
1,the machine is very light and slim and fits nicely into my tv stand .
1,i 've had no problems at all so far and i 'm very happy .
1,"besides the one problem , this machine is amazing ! ."
1,"it plays everything , even vcd 's ."
1,"i will never use all the "" whistles and bells "" this machine is capable of ."
1,but for what i do use it is perfect .
1,owner 's manual has substandard troubleshooting guide .
1,the dvd player is fine .
1,"of course , i was hesitant given the price , but i 've been extremely impressed since receiving it , and bought a second one as a christmas present for my parents ."
1,"the picture is perfect , although i 'm not watching on an hdtv ."
1,"but , dollar for dollar , this dvd player is probably the best out there ."
1,the player does seem to play dvds adequately enough .
1,"there were a few attractive features , such as the small size and the layout of the remote ."
1,i looked into buying an inexpensive dvd player that had more than the standard set of features and this item seemed to be the best in that category .
1,i just hooked it up and everything seemed to be going fine .
1,"still , i was willing to overlook those things as this unit looks sleek and has a myriad of features ! ."
1,this is probably one of the few dvd players at $ 40 that can play almost everything you throw at it .
1,"ability to play most discs - i tried dvd , vcd , dvd-r , audio cd and it played all"
1,good looks
1,this is wonderful to have for your first dvd player .
1,i brought it for my sister in college and she loves it ! .
1,apex is the best cheap quality brand for dvd players .
1,"also , very light and portable ."
1,it will read and play all cd audio disc .
1,i have shopped with amazon before and have been very happy with their performance thus far .
1,it plays original dvds and cds and plays mp3s and jpegs .
1,"also , it was only $ 39 . 99 ( after rebate ) with free shipping and no tax so overall it is a decent player ."
1,good quality video .
1,it did play a dvd-r which was unplayable in my older philips machine .
1,mixed bag i guess but the price was right .
1,this is the third apex product i 've bought and they continue to impress for the price .
1,"the build quality feels solid , it does n 't shake or whine while playing discs , and the picture and sound is top notch ( both dots and dd5 . 1 sound good ) ."
1,"it looks really sleek and stylish , and does everything it claims ."
1,i tried as bunch of different formats to see if it would play and it did .
1,i am very pleased with this product and the price to match and have n 't had any problems .
1,"there are really easy directions for setup and fiddling around with the picture , zoom etc ."
1,"so sit back , relax and brag to all your friends who paid a mountain of money for a dvd player that can 't do half the things this one can , and for a fraction of the price ! ."
1,"noiseless , lightweight and oh yeah ."
1,works great ! .
1,silverfish color really adds a special touch .
1,it plays just about any format ( check before you buy if it plays yours . )
1,"either way , can 't go wrong with this price ."
1,i am really impressed by this dvd player .
1,"for instance , i made several back-ups of my dvd movies using dvd-r ( w ) and + r ( w ) and it plays the dvds ."
1,no matter the format .
1,i recently purchased the canon powershot g3 and am extremely satisfied with the purchase .
1,"the camera is very easy to use , in fact on a recent trip this past week i was asked to take a picture of a vacationing elderly group ."
1,they fired away and the picture turned out quite nicely . ( as all of my pictures have thus far ) .
1,a few of my work constituents owned the g2 and highly recommended the canon for picture quality .
1,i 'm easily enlarging pictures to 8 1/2 x 11 with no vi sable loss in picture quality and not even using the best possible setting as yet ( super fine ) .
1,"bottom line , well made camera , easy to use , very flexible and powerful features to include the ability to use external flash and lense / filters choices ."
1,i 'd highly recommend this camera for anyone who is looking for excellent quality pictures and a combination of ease of use and the flexibility to get advanced with many options to adjust if you like .
1,"this is my first digital camera , and what a ' toy ' it is ! ."
1,"just a little overview , powershot g3 is the flagship of canon 's powershot series and its an slr-like camera , its 4 megapixel and ( almost ) full manual control gives the pictures a touch of brilliance ."
1,"whether you are a novice or an expert , its ease of use and functionality goes together ."
1,overall i 'm happy with my toy .
1,"in a word , "" awesome "" is how i would describe this camera ."
1,"i wo n 't go into the details here , as the online sites ( steve's digicams , previews ) go into great depth in their reviews , but i am very pleased with the features , the speed , the picture quality , the flexibility , the automation , and the functional conveniences this camera offers ."
1,"with the automatic settings , i really have n 't taken a bad picture yet ."
1,"i am absolutely in awe of this camera , canon put enormous quality into the g3 ."
1,i bought my canon g3 about a month ago and i have to say i am very satisfied .
1,i have taken hundreds of photos with it and i continue to be amazed by their quality .
1,"the g3 is loaded with many useful features , and unlike many smaller digital cameras , it is easy to hold steady when using slower shutter speeds ."
1,"despite this minor disappointment , i highly recommend the canon g3 anyone who is serious about digital photography ."
1,i have only had this camera for one full day and i have to say that it is wonderful .
1,the photo quality is amazing and i know i 'm going to have fun with all the features .
1,"1 ) slr like programming and exposure control gives you latitude to be creative , yet its program and auto exposure settings provide excellent photos if you do n 't want to bother with the settings ."
1,excellent range of metering options as well .
1,it 's great to switch to spot metering and actually see it working on the lcd screen .
1,2 ) 4mp is about right for the target market of this camera ( semi-serious amateur photographer )
1,3 ) 4x zoom is nice
1,5 ) its focusing system is also very flexible .
1,"you can move the focus range to almost anywhere in the scene with the push of a button , and it has an on-screen manual focus mode that would be really helpful if shooting a scene that is tough to automatically focus ."
1,the camera has a wonderful set of features .
1,the lcd screen pulls out and rotates in any direction for easy pictures .
1,the optical zoom works great and the 14x digital zoom is a very nice addition although pictures at the highest digital zoom are a little blurry .
1,the highest optical zoom pictures are perfect .
1,"i have not yet seen any of the usual problems with digital pictures ( purple fringing , etc ) so i am very pleased ."
1,"the canon computer software used to download , sort , upload and manage your digital pictures on the computer is very nice and very easy to use ."
1,the menus are easy to navigate and the buttons are easy to use .
1,it is a fantastic camera and well worth the price .
1,recent price drops have made the g3 the best bargain in digital cameras currently available .
1,advanced photo bugs will find more creative control than imaginable .
1,newbies will find the full auto setting will give them perfect pictures right out of the box .
1,4 megapixels is enough for anybody and the photo quality is awesome .
1,those used to 35mm cameras will find the g3 very comfortable and friendly to use .
1,the extended zoom range and faster lense put it at the top of it 's class .
1,i recommend unreservedly the powershot g3 to any potential buyer looking for a first-class digital camera at a reasonable price - there is no better camera out there - period ! .
1,"it gives great pictures , the controls are easy to use , the battery lasts forever on one single charge , the software is very user-friendly and it is beautiful in it chrome casing ."
1,i began taking pics as soon as i got this camera and am amazed at the quality of photos i have took simply by using the auto mode .
1,"this camera has canon 's great calorimetry , plus what you see in the lcd is what you get ."
1,the prints are beautiful ! .
1,"although canon 's batteries are proprietary , they last a really long time , recharge fairly quickly in the camera , plus if you want ' more power ' , you can even find a knockoff charger and spare batteries right here on amazon ."
1,this is a great camera for you ! .
1,"the canon g3 gives tons of control for photo buffs but still has an "" auto "" mode that makes it very easy for the novice to use ."
1,"i love having the option to manually control the f-stop , shutter speed and even focus ."
1,"i was able to take great photos of the 4th of july fire works , and got some amazing shots of the kids playing with sparklers ."
1,"but if you 've used a slr 35mm camera , the controls are very intuitive ! ."
1,"with a quick spin of the dial you can select shutter priority ( for high speed subjects ) , aperture priority ( for focal length ) or full program mode where the camera selects both for ideal photo quality ."
1,the manual mode is easy to use with fast access for the selection of shutter speed and aperture without having to fumble through menu options .
1,this camera also has a great feel and weight to it .
1,"you feel like you are holding something of substance , not some cheap plastic toy ."
1,"the more i work with it , the more i love it ! ."
1,i did n 't think i would find this quality and ease of use for under $ 1500 - i 'm thrilled with my purchase ! .
1,"this is my first digital camera , and i am very pleased with it ."
1,"seriously , this thing has everything that a pro or expert amateur could want ."
1,"but at the same time , it takes wonderful pictures very easily in "" auto "" mode , so that even an average joe like me can use it ! ."
1,four megapixels is great .
1,it is a very amazing product .
1,i highly recommend it .
1,just received this camera two days ago and already love the features it has .
1,takes excellent photos .
1,night mode is clear as day .
1,"i have not played with all the features yet , but the camera is easy to use once you get used to it ."
1,overall it is the best camera on the market .
1,"a ) the picture quality ( color and sharpness of focusing ) are so great , it completely eliminated my doubt about digital imaging -- - how could one eat rice one grain at a time : - ) )"
1,i love this camera .
1,took hundreds of pictures and they were great .
1,"great colors , pictures and white balance ."
1,has 4x optical zoom which is higher than any other in the same price range .
1,"when i took outdoor photos with plenty of light and the objects were n 't moving , the photos were awesome ."
1,the camera was a marvel .
1,it is versatile and seems to be one of the best .
1,"i chose the g3 because of its reputation for very high quality , clean images ."
1,what makes the focus-lock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f8 .
1,"fortunately , the g3 has a hot shoe that can take an external flash , and fortunately for me , i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy : the met 60 ct-4 ."
1,"contrary to what ive read elsewhere , the g3 does sync at 1/250 of a second with third-party flashes , just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon ."
1,what this plug-in reveals is the truly stunning quality of the raw g3 hardware .
1,"without any tweaking at all , if the exposure is accurate , the colors are as realistic as ive ever seen produced by film , and this is a raw image ! ."
1,but at least you re starting with the most photo realistic images ive ever seen from a camera .
1,"i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g3 ( in conjunction with my professional flash system ) , and can easily put up with the cameras limitations , because ive never seen anything better within its resolution limits ."
1,"i 've had this for 3 months now , and i am pleased with my decision ."
1,this is the perfect camera for a photo hobbiest who wants to have easy point and shoot ability as well .
1,"battery life , the drawback to most digital cameras , to quote k . reeves ."
1,"manual functionality is excellent , downloading pictures is quick and a breeze , and the quality is astounding ."
1,the service from the supplier was exceptional .
1,"having used it for more than a month , i can say that it consistently produces topnotch photos ."
1,"by cocking the shutter to the halfway position and getting the settings ready to shoot , i was able to produce excellent stop action photos -- contrary to what other reviewers experienced ."
1,"the camera is a dream to operate in auto mode , but also gives tremendous flexibility in aperture priority , shutter priority , and manual modes ."
1,i can 't write enough positive things about this great little camera ! .
1,but canon never fails to amaze .
1,1 . the ability to selectively switch to raw format during record review gives you incredible more post-processing flexibility .
1,"2 . battery life is over 4 . 5 hours , compared to about 2 . 5 hours for the g2 or the 2 hours for most nikon's ."
1,3 . the remote capture and file viewer software bundled for photo capture is mind-blowing .
1,"4 . the shape of this device is a little squarer , without losing the weight which means better balance and less shaking while clicking ."
1,the light auto-correction is awesome .
1,you could take a picture of a stone glinting in the sun and still avoid the shining glaze and get the contours right .
1,"8 . perhaps inspired by the canon 's factory white-correction settings ( which were found lacking and had to be altered by a user before the white edges from buildings etc could be cleaned out ) , the g3 has much sharper white offsets ."
1,"overall , the g3 delivers what must be considered the best image quality of any current > 4 megapixel digicams , from a detail , tonal balance and color response point of view ."
1,this is quite simply the best you can ask for .
1,"4mp , 4x optical zoom , takes absolutely beautiful photos with detail that challenges all of the above 5mp cameras , easy to understand and use ( has a great swivel lcd screen ) , a lot of features and add-on options , comes with great software ( not to be overlooked ) , and last but by far not least , received my fiance 's stamp of approval ( two thumbs up ! . )"
1,the powershot g3 is a great camera .
1,because it can help a so-so photographer take spectacular photos ! .
1,"4 megapixels is plenty for all but pros , and you will not be disappointed with the results of this camera ."
1,it 's slightly lighter than the g2 and packed with even more features .
1,this is my first digital camera and i could n 't be happier .
1,i love the quality of the pictures .
1,they look fantastic .
1,the canon g3 is perhaps the best 4mp camera out there .
1,"with canon , you get pictures that appear to be photos , not still camcorder shots ."
1,i love the es based controls and easy menus .
1,"i bought it for my trip to buns aries , and also used it at the iguassu falls , and could not have asked for more perfect performance ! ."
1,"this camera is worth every penny , and i highly recommend it ! ."
1,another point of note : the battery life is incredible ! .
1,am i ever glad that i decided on this camera ! .
1,"i 've only had it a week , but so far , everything about this camera is making me happy ."
1,very intuitive menus are a big plus on this camera .
1,the standard battery include with the g3 is a camcorder battery that will allow me to take pictures all day without worrying about charging .
1,"the optical zoom is awesome , and the viewfinder reflects the settings of the zoom ."
1,the best 4 megapixel/4x optical zoom camera available and fairly easy to use .
1,because this camera is beautiful .
1,the g3 looks like a work of art ! .
1,"its silver magnesium finish is stunning , and the sharp lines and excellent grip are better than any other camera i 've seen ."
1,i am very pleased with it so far .
1,it is very simple to import via photo 2 and then move them to photoshop .
1,i am quite happy with the camera .
1,it comes with a clearly written manual and the learning curve is not too too steep .
1,"yes , i recommend it over the competition ."
1,"best camera ever . from the image quality , color , function , i can say almost everything ."
1,"this camera has a cool stitch pictures feature , to find out more just log on to canon 's website ."
1,"first and foremost , it will take better pic 's than most film camera 's ."
1,this camera has none of these flaws and will be something you 'll use all the time .
1,"however , for a $ 600 - $ 800 budget , i think this camera is an excellent choice ."
1,"it has a beautiful design , lots of features , very easy to use , very configurable and customizable , and the battery duration is amazing ! ."
1,"also , the display is "" hinged "" and it can be placed in a myriad of positions , or to protect it against any damage ."
1,another good thing is that this camera seems to introduce much less noise in dark places than others i 've seen .
1,i have owned this camera for a short time and would n 't give it up for anything .
1,it surpasses my greatest expectations in a 4mp camera . .
1,in general it is easy to use and well laid out .
1,it makes up for this by being extremely easy to use with well laid out controls that can be learned quickly .
1,the g3 has most if not all of the features that you would want from a semi-pro / pro slr with a good range of manual options for those who know something about photography .
1,"in the hands of someone who does n 't , it will yield good results on idiot program / auto mode ."
1,the functionality on this camera is mind-blowing .
1,canon have packed a lot in here and the options and controls are easy to use and logically laid out .
1,learning how to use it will not take very long .
1,the image quality is excellent .
1,range of functions - as indicated above - it has something for everyone : point and shoot power plus advanced functions for those who are serious about photography .
1,this is by far the finest camera in its price and category i have ever used .
1,the macro works great for medical photographs and the auto mode is terrific for point and shoot .
1,this camera is closest to perfect than any other diagram that is 4-5 megapixel .
1,i 'm glad canon decided to keep the 4mp resolution and improved upon it with new technology ; .
1,"in terms of the shots taken , this camera is insanely great ! ."
1,the pictures are fabulous and their is a ( short ) learning curve to it ; . there are tons of features i have n 't even gotten to .
1,"i 've been pleased with the picture quality and durability in snow , car , boat and wind ."
1,the camera 's a work of art / science -- that 's understood .
1,"it takes great pictures , operates quickly , and feels solid ."
1,everything else about the camera is great .
1,"if you strictly use the lcd and not the view finder , i highly recommend the camera ."
1,"and so far , i 've been very pleased ."
1,"the larger lens of the g3 gives better picture quality in low light , and the 4-times optical zooms gets you just that much closer ."
1,the moveable lcd screen is great .
1,"the tiny ( postage-stamp sized ) remote unit is wonderful : not only does it trigger the shutter , it can also be used to zoom and review pictures ."
1,the hot shoe flash attachment allowed me to buy and use a sophisticated flash unit :
1,"i needed three batteries to keep myself going with the s330 , but the battery in the g3 is a real powerhouse :"
1,"the g3 has a different type of battery charging system from the smaller canon cameras : the battery needs to be charged while in the camera , but the charging system also enables you to use the camera while plugged in without running down the battery ."
1,"i have yet to try using all of the adjustment options : shutter priority , aperture priority , light metering adjustments , etc . , but all controls are well thought out and and the manual is relatively clear ."
1,"i was worried that 4 megapixel photos would download more slowly , but there 's no difference in working with the files ."
1,i 've now had the camera for two months and i 'm even more pleased with it .
1,"very comfortable camera , easy to use , and the best digital photos you 're going to get at this price ."
1,i 've been using the g3 for about six weeks and it has proven itself to be all that it 's advertised .
1,"all-in-all , i believe this is arguably the best non-slr digital camera on the market ."
1,canon 's optics are better and i believe their processing algorithms are also better .
1,"simply , the canon g3 is the best digital camera out there today at this price point ."
1,the battery life of this camera is twice that of the nikon 5000 and is better than anything else i 've seen .
1,"even with these shortcomings , i still think it is the best digital camera available under $ 1200 ."
1,definitely a great camera .
1,proven canon built quality and lens .
1,feels solid in hand .
1,we really enjoyed shooting with the canon powershot sd500 .
1,it has an exterior design that combines form and function more elegantly than any point-and-shoot we 've ever tested .
1,"a digic ii-powered image-processing system enables the sd500 to snap a limitless stream of 7-megapixel photos at a respectable clip , its start-up time is tops in its class , and it delivers decent photos when compared to its competition ."
1,the sd500 rivals the canon g6 in image quality .
1,this camera is truely superb .
1,"the startup time , quality of pictures and videos is outstanding ."
1,they say that they are the best pictures they have ever see from a compact .
1,i went out and got the canon today .
1,"i 've taken about hundred shot with the canon , in varying lighting situations , all in auto mode , and not one blurry picture ! . ! . ! ."
1,"i did not conduct a rigorous test , but just took some identical shots in identical lighting with both cameras , and the canon won hands down ."
1,sharper pictures .
1,"the canon is very small , definitely pocket size , but still easy to hold firmly ."
1,"it powers up quickly , so you won 't miss that quick shot ."
1,good image quality .
1,"all i have to say is that the pics i get with my sd500 are both rich and color and high in detail , the user interface is awesome , the battery charger is tiny and super light and sd cards are relatively cheap and getting cheaper all the time ."
1,camera is a paper weight .
1,i have been very impressed with my purchase of the sd500 i bought it at the beginning of the month as the ultimate pocket camera and have shot 300 images so far with it .
1,"the pictures are tack sharp , colors are vivid , and at 7 mega pixels the quality is plenty high to manipulate and crop images to your hearts desire ."
1,"powerup is quick , and you can even set your favorite image to display for a second or so as it turns on ."
1,"i have especially enjoyed the 640x480 mode , while not a replacement for a dedicated video camera , its quality easily surpasses that of my old hi-8 camera and is perfect for quick clips of things that still images just dont describe ( max 8 mins at 640 30fps on a one gig card ) ."
1,"audio is mono and fairly acceptable , quiet also with little distortions ."
1,the battery life is not that of the casio 's but its good and your going to get better pictures in my opinion with the battery life you've got .
1,glad to see the ed . revised the previous statements regarding image quality .
1,"my sd500 focuses flawlessly , does not "" whine "" during video , and my pictures are razor sharp ."
1,this camera is bulletproof .
1,start up is so quick
1,you can take pictures seconds after you turn the camera on . . . literally ! .
1,"big lcd screen - at least for me , 2 "" is enough"
1,"great picture quality - in automatic mode , quality is great ."
1,"when you learn how to change some settings , you can make the quality even better"
1,"digital zoom is clear too . . . say you used all 3x optical zoom , try to do digital zoom then . . . just try not to shake the camera at all and you 'll still get a clear good quality picture"
1,great video clip quality for a digital camera - so much better than my old one ( canon a60 ( ? . ) . . . the 2 . 0 megapixel one ) .
1,"i connected my camera to the tv and played some video clips and for a digital camera to take such good quality clips , i give it 5/5 stars = ) oh and btw , while you take video clips , you can zoom it too ! . ( digital zoom only though ) . . . but still . . . ( my old one can 't do that . . . you have to zoom it first if you want then take the video clip . )"
1,photo stitch ( merge pictures to create a panoramic one . . even my old one can do this and it 's really cool to have it now still )
1,turn the camera on while pressing the button ( or is it the menu button ? . i have to check again = ) ) and it 'l show you the time and date .
1,i highly recommend this camera to anybody looking for a compact camera that can take good quality pictures .
1,"if you 'll only read the whole manual , you 'll find out even more cool features and you 'll learn how to manipulate the quality you want to achieve and all those modes will make sense after reading"
1,it 's such a great camera ! . i think it really was worth the investment = )
1,"if you haven 't noticed , they designed it so that you can also take vertical pictures when you do the self-timer ."
1,they made the other end of the camera flat so you can put the camera upright on a flat surface if you don 't like to take the usual horizontal pictures using the self-timer .
1,"i bought this camera two days ago , and i 'm very pleased to say that it has been worth the money ."
1,"if you on the other hand always use automatic settings ( and not manual ) you should be just fine , as the camera features some of the best automatic settings i have ever seen ."
1,"all in all , this is the camera for you if you can spare the extra cost in price ."
1,having the digic ii chip helps a lot .
1,this camera takes amazing pictures and its size can not be beat .
1,i still can 't believe how fast it starts up .
1,i take a lot of pictures and this camera is my first choice .
1,"i still have my s70 because i like the wider lens sometimes , but in general , if you are looking for a small camera with the whole package , the sd500 is the only one you should buy ."
1,"i love the rounded edges now , fits so much better in a pocket , jeans or suit ."
1,"i tell you now , after lot of shooting in many different situations , this camera is amazing ."
1,the size of the camera is perfect .
1,fits comfortably in my inside jacket pocket or in my pants pocket .
1,there was no compromise this little camera does amazing things .
1,"i like to take pictures when i go out at night and perhaps some people would complain that noise levels are high at higher iso 's but i don 't really care that much , i think it gives the pictures a certain real-life quality ."
1,the flash is surprisingly good and even the video quality is excellent .
1,i 'd be happy to talk to anyone about this camera .
1,"this camera is an excellent choice for an ultracompact , take anywhere device and boasts an outstanding movie mode to boot ."
1,the instruction manuals and documentation are excellent so that the learning curve will be much less steep .
1,"i 've only had this camera for a few days , but it 's been great ."
1,the photo quality is amazing .
1,"it 's fast , feels great in your hand and looks great too ."
1,i 've printed several photos and the prints look as good as the screen views .
1,as any digital camera owner knows is that when you go to take a picture of a moving object to expect some blurring but with some preliminary testing we had simone move there hands back and forth under the lense and another person take the picture and suprisingly a crystal clear image appeared on the decently sized screen .
1,another thing i like about this camera is the way that you can swap colors around and the impressive video quality i would advise any person in the market for a camera to pay the little extra on the hefty $500 price tag and get a quality camera .
1,"moreover , apart from the plastic cable cover , the camera has a nice , solid feel about it , and it 's so tiny , i take it with me wherever i go ."
1,"as it turns out , this is an awesome camera ! ."
1,"however , this ultracompact allows the photographer to personalize his or her shooting preferences through a variety of preset and user definable modes ."
1,the sd500 software install was seamless and the product documentation is very detailed .
1,"bottom line , this camera will give you a lot of bang for the buck ! ."
1,"i don 't know why cnet says there is a problem with focus , i have all my pictures sharp and high quality ."
1,"very good "" every day "" camera . fits nicely in the pocket of my jeans and takes quality photos ."
1,"if you want a sharp looking , fast digital camera and you don 't need or want manual controls , then this is the camera for you ! ."
1,am so glad i bought this camera .
1,all the good reviews for the sd500 are true .
1,the view finder shows crystal clear pictures that will look even better when you get them to the computer .
1,the included software removes any red eye easily .
1,"if you are looking for a small camera to throw in your pocket , take great pics and video , get the sd500 ."
1,this is overall the best point and shoot camera i 've used .
1,placement of the buttons and software user interface is near perfect .
1,i also tend to like the sliding cover/on switch found on many compact ps cameras since it 's much faster and easier to power on if you need to take that instant shot .
1,"overall build quality , good macros-results , impressive video-quality , good pictures with flash ( good colours , sharp results ) , excellent auto white balance ."
1,"could be better to be a perfect camera ( and some competitors do some of this better ) : purple fringing , details in high-light area , noise over iso100 , red-eyes , ( few ) processing artefact's , ( few ) loss of some details especially of the hairs of peoples in low light , automatic autofocus , whizzing while video-playback , better video compression ( smaller viedo-files ) , more manual controls , longer lasting battery , indicator for battery , better protection of the lcd , less weight ."
1,"when the overall image quality ( especially natural colours , details , natural looking of the pictures ) is the most important thing , then this camera its top notch and very impressive ."
1,"in low light with flash i found it clear better then the sony p200 ( too much red , colours overall not as natural but fewer red-eyes ) ."
1,"i found best results in most situation with manual/center auto focus , manual mode , iso 100 ( shorter aperture-time , so more often sharper images as with iso 50 ) , auto white balance ( auto white balance is better than of the other canon cameras i have and they already do very-well ) ."
1,i upgraded from a very small 3 . 2 max camera to this camera with great results .
1,good color and very little needed to correct photos on paint shop pro .
1,neat feature for self-timer allows you to record two different warnings .
1,the manual is excellent .
1,"also , multiple picture feature is very , very fast ."
1,very fast powerup and great speed when taking multiple pictures .
1,perfect size ! . beats the competition by leaps and bounds .
1,i am impressed with this camera inside and out .
1,i love the camera .
1,this camera is perfect for the person who wants a compact camera that produces excellent photos in just about any situation .
1,the camera res ponce is very quick .
1,"i have a canon a 70 , and now this sd500 , its amazing , how this little camera produces , such great pics , it even brings out ur pimples on the face ."
1,and the video quality is amazing .
1,and it fits right in my pocket much easier than my old s30 .
1,i want to start off saying that this camera is small for a reason .
1,"i 'm in high school , and this camera is perfect for what i use it for , carrying it around in my pocket so i can take pictures whenever i want to , of my friends and of funny things that happen ."
1,i 'd say that this camera is perfect .
1,"ok , not quite everything . . . but this camera is so compact that you will have it by your side when you need it ."
1,"i bought this camera for the same reason many of you are considering it , or have already bought it -- it 's size ."
1,"it is amazingly small , it 's hard to believe all that has been packed into this camera ."
1,"it is so small that i am able to keep it in my pocket , and i don 't have to fear that it will get ruined in my pocket because it is so durable ."
1,"there is also a small covering for the lens , so you need not worry that the lens will get scratched ."
1,"the picture quality surprised me , when i first saw this camera i saw how small it was an instantly assumed that the picture quality would not be good -- but i was wrong ! ."
1,the picture quality of this camera is outstanding ( taking its ' size and price into consideration ) .
1,"the focus is great , though , if you are not taking a macro shot ."
1,"i have come across many other beginner cameras that i prefer over this camera , but the thing you have to keep in mind about this camera is the size ."
1,"if you are just looking for something to keep with you at all times , then this is a great camera choice ."
1,"after considering my needs further and researching the marketplace , i decided on the s100 ."
1,"it has given me zero problems , and the more i use it , the better i become at taking advantage of its strengths ."
1,this wonderfully small digital camera produces fantastically good pictures printed on any decent photo-quality printer ( with photo quality paper ) .
1,it will not replace your high-end 35mm slr but it 's a great toy to keep near you at all times for snapshots .
1,this is the best camera you can have for digital images if you want to :
1,take quick pictures with excelent resolution
1,hate to wait between shots
1,download it fast to your computer
1,have a great and easy to use bundled software
1,travel with it without knowing you have it in your pocket
1,"fyi , battery doesn 't die if you don 't use lcd"
1,the color and light i captured with this camera on a 12-day trip to turkey ( gorgeous vividly colored ceramic tiles inside darkened mosques ) were far superior to anything i 've ever gotten with a traditional 35-mm film camera .
1,i love this camera .
1,"i don 't believe this camera is still available . but if you can find one , you might like to get it ."
1,"it 's still one of the smallest 2mp digital cameras on the market , and absolutely one of the best-built most stylish cameras ever ."
1,i am very pleased with my purchase .
1,i 've been incredibly happy with this camera .
1,this camera is great if you 're used to a high-end slr .
1,"it 's overkill for simple snapshots , unless you 've got way too much money to blow ."
1,"exposure compensation in 1/3 stop increments ( i leave it set on +1/3 stop to brighten up the default exposure , which goes a bit dark for my taste ) ."
1,"slow-syncro flash , macro/infinity mode , etc ."
1,"the ss body is wonderful , feels high-quality ."
1,it 's the same body as the popular elp2 aps camera ( take a look at a standard credit card from your wallet and you 'll have an idea of the front profile ! . ) .
1,"i discovered that the camera has a manual mode that gives you total control over exposure , white balance , flash ( red eye , person against bright background , flash on , flash off , flash automatic ) ."
1,it fits in your pocket .
1,the panorama setting is unbelievable ! .
1,you have the option to have the flash automatic or off .
1,the new canon s300 is 33% larger and 26% heavier than the s100 .
1,"it has one more resolution of 1024x768 and a "" normal "" compression mode . and , it has the 3x zoom ."
1,but it takes gorgeous pictures for a 2 . 1 mp camera .
1,i love this camera ! .
1,i got this camera for an unbelievably low price at amazon .
1,i would recommend this camera unequivocally ! .
1,i got this camera for an unbelievably low price at amazon .
1,i would recommend this camera unequivocally ! .
1,but this does work even if you turn off the lcd viewing -- great battery saver .
1,"a great camera , but here are some points which i don 't notice in most of the reviews here , which may be of concern especially to the more advanced amatuer :"
1,i purchased the elph s100 mainly because i thought it was cool .
1,"the camera does a great job with exposure and prints made with my professional printer looks great ( not as good as prints from my pro digital camera , but still very good ) ."
1,"but i was ready to upgrade and when i discovered that canon was going to come out with an even smaller digital camera with a higher resolution , i had to have the s100 ."
1,"this is my second digital camera , but i 'm much more impressed with the canon s100 digital elph than i ever was with my kodak dc240 ."
1,"this camera is so light and tiny that i literally carry it everywhere with me , which is great considering i 'm an artist and like to capture interesting items for future painting ."
1,the software that comes with the digital elph is very nice and intuitive .
1,the photostitch software is very cool if you want to do any 360 degree panorama shots .
1,"other than that , i love this camera ."
1,the pictures are uniformly excellent and color rendering is perfect .
1,the good : small size ; . durable-seeming metal case ; . easy to use ; . visually distinctive ; . good picture quality ; . fast usb connection ; . mostly intuitive operation ; . really cool photostitch software that knits pictures together to give wide panoramas .
1,"if compact size is your highest priority in a 2-megapixel camera , the canon powershot s100 digital elph is a standout choice and aptly named for its diminutive design ."
1,"the s100 's image quality rates in the middle of its class , but it can still be a reasonable choice for students , families , or small businesses looking for an ultra-portable camera that weighs less than half a pound with media and battery pack ."
1,"i purchased this camera before it went on sale , and while i wouldn 't have minded keeping the extra $$$ , it was definitely worth it ."
1,"i have been absolutely , completely satisfied with the product and its capabilities ."
1,"this is a great product , and canon has done an excellent job ."
1,i received this little jewel as a gift and i can honestly say absolutely love it .
1,"i give this product five stars for its usability , performance , expandability , and definitely looks ! ."
1,"first , i have to say that i have never had the slightest problem with this camera or the software ."
1,"the software has been installed on windows 95 , 98 , 2000 and xp and i haven 't had any problems with it ."
1,"the camera is solid , performs well , takes good pictures , and the battery lasts pretty long if you disable the lcd viewfinder ."
1,"they are razor sharp , the color balance is perfect , and the focus is great ."
1,"i must say , i think this is the coolest camera i 've ever owned ! ."
1,"first , it really is tiny ; . the size of a pack of cigarettes , maybe a scotch deeper ."
1,"second , it is incredibly easy to use ."
1,"i just went on a quick photo shoot in nyc 's central park today , and what a bunch of beautiful photos i took , if i do say so myself ( and i do ! . )"
1,"the camera is as easy to use as a point and shoot , and with instant review on the lcd screen , you can retake any flubbed shots on the spot ."
1,"the two-times optical zoom operates smoothly and quietly , and lo and behold , a two-piece shutter-like cap automatically slides closed over the lens when you turn the camera off ."
1,i also had no problems installing or running the camera software on my pc .
1,"at any rate , if you have been interested in digital photography but the price and confusion have held you back , consider the canon s100 digital elph ."
1,"it really is the perfect travel camera , plus it offers the convenience of digital photography ."
1,"really like it , easy to use , great images , very intuitive , fits in my jacket pocket ."
1,"i was looking for a compact , rugged ( i carry it hiking , skiing , boating , etc ) camera which is easy to use ."
1,"i wanted standard memory expansion ( cf cards ) , macro mode , and if possible , a waterproof housing ( for kayaking ) ."
1,even with the waterproof housing it is small .
1,the lens retracts and has its own metal cover so you don 't need to fuss with a lens cap .
1,the metal housing seems very rugged .
1,"the macro mode works well , although it takes some practice since the camera doesn 't clearly indicate when it can 't focus ."
1,"the white-led backlit lcd is very bright and crisp , even in sunlight , and relatively easy on the battery ."
1,the panorama modes are wonderful .
1,"it 's so small and light , even with a spare battery , you really can take it anywhere ."
1,in auto mode anyone can use it as a point and shoot camera .
1,the manual modes give you a lot of control over exposure and white balance ( but there is no manual focus or manual exposure ) .
1,there are better cameras but none anywhere near as light and compact .
1,1- small .
1,very small .
1,"i 've had a lot of cameras , but this one is actually being used , and not stored in a desk : it 's all ways in my shiest pocket ."
1,2- excellent picture quality and so simple to use ! . ! . ! .
1,4- looks great .
1,silver metal case -not plastic .
1,5- excelent software package .
1,6- small but very clear tft screen .
1,don 't care about sunlight : it 's tft .
1,7- 360 panoramic pictures are a very big deal .
1,"i researched and researched between getting the canon s20 or the canon s100 , and of course i got the latter ! ."
1,i was looking for something that wasn 't too complicated to use and to help the pics i post on ebay show more detail .
1,"this camera is great , wonderfully small , and has attractive hi-tech casing ."
1,very easy to use for someone like me who 's just hopping on the digital camera bandwagon .
1,the controls are easy to understand and big enough that they are easy to see and use .
1,the optical and digital zooms combine to give an effective 4x zoom .
1,"this is enough capacity and capability to do a complete household inventory , for example ."
1,"so , why the small digital elph , rather than one of the other cameras with better resolution or picture quality ? . size[+2]"
1,"after getting one for christmas from amazon , i 'm now a believer : the digital elph is truly the world 's smallest digital camera that shoots great pictures ."
1,i 've had this camera just over 2 years and it takes pretty good pictures .
1,"the size is tiny , which i love ."
1,this camera is so easy to use ! .
1,"all the features are incredibly intuitive , even for a novice like me ."
1,"the pictures are beautiful , and the camera is so small you can carry it anywhere ."
1,"i , as many others , have waited for many years for the convergence of price , features , size and ease of use to hit that happy center point ."
1,"i bought this little guy a few weeks back , and i have to say that i never had so much fun with a new toy as this ."
1,you indefinitely appreciate the small size .
1,"while , there are flaws with the machine , the xtra gets five stars because of its affordability ."
1,it is the most bang-for-the-buck out there .
1,"like it 's predecessor , the quickly revised nx , this player boasts a decent size and weight , a relatively-intuitive navigational system that categorizes based on id3 tags , and excellent sound ( widely known to be better than ipod - not surprising considering the number of years creative has been in the audio peripheral business ) ."
1,"the xtra improves upon the zen nx with a larger , now-blue backlit screen , which is infinitely better ."
1,"i chose this one because from what i read , it was the best deal for the money ."
1,another reason i got it is because you can put wma files on it .
1,the software is great .
1,"transfering is easy , the software makes everything pretty easy ."
1,"even the battery life is great - it advertises 14 hours , it 's actually a little less but still good ."
1,they player 's interface itself is also very easy to use .
1,"get it , it 's woth every penny ! . ! ."
1,"i 've had it for a week now , do n 't regret the purchase one bit , and i never leave home without it ."
1,"software is easy to use ( although red hat software is better , but costs money )"
1,"much cheaper than i-pod good looking player ( beautiful blue back-lit screen ) if you 've read about the player , some have complained about the lack of a viewing hole for the face when the case is on , but this is good because the face does n 't get damaged / scratched fast transfer rate"
1,the zen xtra sounds great with good headphone and well re cored mp3s .
1,at 8 ounces it is pretty light but not as light as the ipod .
1,the battery is replaceable ( a real plus ) and there is a leather case ( another real plus ) .
1,so far the software for the pc works easily .
1,"by the way , it looks nice also ."
1,it 's worth it .
1,my two main requirements were longer battery life and lower price : i found both .
1,"the controls are on the side instead of on the front , which i like , because that 's where my thumb is when i hold the thing ! ."
1,the scroll wheel is a big improvement over the ipod touchpad .
1,"the included leather pouch is a big plus : it actually protects the unit well , something a lot of ' carrying cases ' fail to do with other audio devices ."
1,"other plusses : changeable battery , loads of presets for environments , decent construction , still quite small and light despite being slightly bigger than an ipod ."
1,"overall : small , sounds great , and less expensive than apple 's overpriced ipod ! ."
1,( batteries last longer too ! . )
1,the creative labs zen xtra has all the features the i-pod has and if you get if from amazon your only going to pay $ 300 for this great player .
1,"i 've had it for about 2 weeks and it 's the best player i 've seen , and used , ever ."
1,"the music is easy to get to ( all of the menus are easy to understand despite what alot of i-pod owners say ) and if you know how to search for an artist by name online , then you can do the same with the zen ."
1,"the screen is very easy to read and the blue light is bright enough to read at night , but dim enough so it does n 't blind you when you stare too long ."
1,"all in all this a great player that blows the i-pod away , with easy to use and understand features , software that is simple to understand and use , and a great sound ( which is all that matters in a mp3 player ) ."
1,it 's a very intuitive program .
1,i had no problems following their installation instructions .
1,the menus are very easy to navigate .
1,the other controls are all very easy to use .
1,"it has several play options , one of the best is an option to shuffle , based on all or a certain playlist ."
1,it also costs a lot less than the ipod .
1,the earbuds that come with it are n 't that bad .
1,"they 're pretty comfortable , stay in place and deliver a decent audio quality ."
1,this is a good deal for music and data storage .
1,"on the positive side , the sound of the player is pretty good , once you have everything configured ."
1,"i have n 't had time to really push this player to the limit , but audio aspects on the nomad are satisfactory , as should be expected from creative labs ."
1,"when it came down to it , the price on this player is hard to beat ."
1,other than that this thing is great . . .
1,zennx 's replaceable battery was the deciding factor in my purchase of zennx over ipod .
1,"the zennx will keep running for the price of a replacement battery , just like any other battery-powered appliance ."
1,"i love my new nomad , its great ! ."
1,"for some this might be a problem , but for the price of a 30 gig ipod , you can get a 60gb nomad , the ipod simply pales in comparison ."
1,"the software is very easy to use , and within 30 minutes of opening my box , i was out and about listening to any one of my 80 cds ."
1,"the free ( i didnt know they still did that ) carrying case is really protective , and to me its the only accessory you need ( except good headphones ) ."
1,"but if you want a great deal and a great mp3 player , get the nomad ."
1,best electronic i 've bought since i was born .
1,"so easy to set up , had some problems with my archos ."
1,"just easily drag and drop files into the nomad explorer and from there you easily alter id tags and sort your music according to your liking , by artist , song title , genre , etc ."
1,"not only is it functional and runs super smooth & fast , but it is also eye candy ."
1,very sleek & stylish as well as the screen options and visuals it has .
1,"the leather case it comes with is pretty nice , similar to a pda style case and does hold and protect it perfectly ."
1,all the buttons & necessary lil ' gadgets are on the sides of the player which is nice for when you are holding it in the palm of your hand .
1,the sound quality is also nice . . . after i hooked up my sony headphones instead of those factory earbuds it comes with .
1,"lots of sound options , has an equalizer almost like winamp with the options ."
1,navigation is so smooth and finding files is a cinch .
1,also navigating while playing music is a plus unlike my previous player .
1,"oh , and the screen saver feature is pretty sweet ^ _ ^"
1,"another plus in my book , no file limits ! ."
1,i have over 2000 files in my playlist at the moment and the random does a nice job mixing it up .
1,i am quite happy having over 10 gigs of music stored on this baby as well as a few gigs of media files in the data folder .
1,i really have no complaints over this unit .
1,i really do recommend this to anyone in need of a new player .
1,i have no complaints with this mp3 player .
1,getting files onto it is quick and painless .
1,then sorting the files is easy as pie .
1,and it holds so much music and audio files .
1,my music demands are pretty intense and this handles those demands without problems .
1,the battery is nice .
1,the lcd screen was very large and readable .
1,"compared to everything else in this category , this is most definately the best bang for the buck ."
1,i gave the zen 5 stars because it 's excellent for the class that it is in and it 's not really appropriate to rate it based on players in a different class .
1,"sound quality was the same between the two , but the zen did have more sound adjustments with the normal eax features ."
1,i love this player .
1,i love this player and would probably go with creative labs again .
1,"the software was great , as long as you have an administrative user account ( windows xp ) ."
1,"anyway , this player is a great deal and i really love it ."
1,way less expensive than the ipod .
1,i find it pretty easy to use . . . and unlike the remote interface for the audigy 2 nx ( on the pc ) . . .
1,not counting the time i spent editing the songs ( i suppose i should 've done it anyway on my pc ) the transfer was pretty painless .
1,"bought the 30gb xtra a couple of weeks ago , and so far it has been excellent ."
1,"i still have over 19gb left , and already have over 200 cd 's on it ."
1,"both are very easy to learn & use , and intuitive enough for even a novice ."
1,"ripping & transferring tunes is basic , and pretty fast ( even on a 1 . 1 usb ) ."
1,"people also have complained about the case not having a window , but that 's not really a big deal to me either -- the case is sturdy and offers very good protection ."
1,it 's easy enough to pop it open to see what song you 're listening to .
1,"the sound quality is excellent ( and i 'm fussy with that stuff ) , the unit looks cool , screen is bright and easy to read , and the replaceable battery means a major advantage over the ipod ( besides the price , but everyone knows that ) ."
1,"you of course have some good customization options with the unit as well ( sound presets , navigating options , playlists , etc ) ."
1,all other buttons are pretty sensitive to touch and work well .
1,"but i 've already emailed creative tech support about it , and gotten timely responses - they will fix it for me if necessary . . ."
1,"it still fits in the palm of your hand , and it 's not heavy ."
1,"bottom line . . . great product , unbeatable price ."
1,i just received my 40gb zen xtra yesterday and i 'm extremely pleased with it .
1,the setup and transfer process was cake for me .
1,now that i have all my music on it there has n 't been any more problems .
1,the screen is large and bright and has all the info i need where i need it .
1,the eax mode that keeps the volume at the same level for any song will come in handy when i take my holiday plane rides .
1,all in all though i 'm very happy with my new mp3 player .
1,i purchased the nomad jukebox zen xtra 40gb and it is fantastic ! .
1,i found using the supplied mediasource software very easy .
1,ripping your songs and creating playlists could n 't be any easier .
1,i found using mediasource to load your songs to the nomad jukebox to be much easier and faster than using windows explorer .
1,being a creative product the playback quality is unbeatable .
1,when i played back a symphony orchestra you would swear that you were seated dead center in front of the orchestra - it 's that good ! .
1,the sound quality with jazz and pop music is equally superior .
1,actually using the nomad jukebox is easy and uncomplicated .
1,finding a particular song ( s ) or album on the nomad jukebox is fast and easy .
1,the high resolution screen is easy to read and has a backlight .
1,"i can highly recommend this product because of its ease of use ( hardware and software ) , playback quality and value for the price ."
1,just bought one & i 've enjoyed it to date .
1,"nice palm sized unit , somewhat bigger then the ipod but not an issue if you 're not going to try & jog with it or something ."
1,"all reviews i 've seen seem to indicate that the creative mp3 jukeboxes have the best sound quality of these 2nd generation jukebox ed ( ipod , archos , dell , samsung ) ."
1,the eax settings are somewhat superfluous but not really a negative .
1,- great value 40gb vs 10 gb ipod for the price
1,- best in class sound
1,- large easy readable screen
1,"working for 10 hours with it on "" shuffle "" totally rocks ! . ! ."
1,i love it ! . ! .
1,i had no problems setting up the software and getting my favorite cd 's transferred .
1,transfers are surprisingly quick through usb 2 . 0 .
1,"it is great sounding , even with the supplied earbuds ."
1,"i must have differing preferences than others here , as i prefer the supplied earbuds to the sony 's that i thought sounded good on other players ."
1,i love the storage in this thing .
1,"despite the things that i have listed so far , i could live with this item since it saves me from lugging a cd case to work , to the gym , in the car , etc . ."
1,"this is my second creative labs mp3 player , and it is definitely a fine product ."
1,first of all the player 's sound quality is superior to the ipod .
1,the player 's software is very easy to use and very good .
1,"compared to musicmatch , the software has a better filing system and easier to use ."
1,"to keep it short , this is cheaper , and in my opinion a better choice than an ipod ."
1,this thing seriously is a good player though .
1,overall i like the unit .
1,1 ) price / gb of storage
1,2 ) storage capacity
1,3 ) user replaceable battery
1,overall i like it .
1,the storage capacity is great .
1,the price compared to the ipod is great .
1,"price , along with the replaceable battery ( which i understand apple charges a small fortune to replace - as well as the hassle of returning it ) were the two main factors on why i picked the nomad ."
1,i 've had no problems with the software .
1,i found it intuitive to use ( i did n 't read any documentation for it and was using it successfully within a few minutes ) .
1,"this is a nice feature ( i . e . it 's early in the morning and you rather listen to "" easy listening "" rather than "" heavy metal "" - no problem ."
1,the software comes with plenty of defaults genres .
1,the sound from the player is ok .
1,"this thing is great , i like to use it to pick up tough stains on my counter top and also to listen to my old 8-track records ."
1,"one good thing , it is 40 gb of disk space ( well , it is 38 gb in reality ) ."
1,for the price and features it is really good .
1,"the 30gb zen xtra rocks my socks , spills my beer , but does n 't wash my car ."
1,"longer battery life , greater accessibility to online music services , and pc compatibility are the sensibilities ."
1,i just purchased this player and i have to say that i love it .
1,"the sound is excellent , the battery life is excellent , the fact that the battery is replacable is excellent , and finally the price , $ 200 cheaper than the 40gb ipod , is excellent ."
1,"the nomad is not ugly , it is not that big , it comfortably fits in my pocket , or heavy , and the controls are not hard to get used to ."
1,"so far i have no complaints and i recommend this to anyone who wants quality over appearance , also anyone who wants a hard drive based mp3 player and wants to pay next to nothing ."
1,i just bought this player today and i already love it .
1,"otherwise , this player is awesome ! ."
1,it has a clear blue light that allows you to see everything on the screen easily .
1,"the volume range is great , so you can blast it if you want ."
1,"overall , this player is awesome and i definately recommend it ."
1,i received this item for christmas and it has met and exceeded all my standards .
1,"naturally i did quite a bit of review before purchasing ( i recommend www . no madness . net ) , and price-wise zens are unbeatable ."
1,"compared to other leading dd mp3 players , the value per gb is the tops ."
1,"- sound quality : excellent , everything you would expect from this company ."
1,- the unit is easy to use and intuitive .
1,- uploading music is quick and easy .
1,"although the supplied software can be annoying at times , on whole it is excellent ."
1,"- the unit itself its well structured , with just the buttons you need and none you do n 't ."
1,"as often mentioned , the scroll tab is average , however , not difficult to use or horrible ."
1,"the screen is large , defined , and easy to read , and the silver unit is naturally cool ."
1,"there are lots of interesting features included such as eax , and customization ."
1,"- the replacable battery is great since once it eventually wears out ( as all lithium batteries do ) , you will be able to buy another easily ."
1,"also , the nomad 's 14 hours of battery life versus 8 is handy ."
1,"- equipment included is average , but that is n 't a big deal since thats not what you are buying it for ."
1,"the headphone earbuds are average , so just use your regular pair instead ."
1,this player is an ideal purchase .
1,i have no problem using the player itself and i feel it is a very good player .
1,i have the software working fine now and the mp3 player is fantastic .
1,so once i worked out the problem with the software this mp3 player is worth the money it cost .
1,i 'm very pleased with my zx so here 's a quick review .
1,"it is small overall , bigger than the ipod , but keep in mind that this is because different , less expensive but not necessarily inferior technology is used in the zx ."
1,"the zx boasts superior sound quality than the ipod , however it compromises a bit of the unit 's size in doing so ."
1,"the lcd is larger than the previous model , the nx , and has a bright blue backlight which illuminates the screen more successfully than the nx 's green backlight did ."
1,"the scroll wheel is easy to use and works great for me , however many have complained that the wheel is cumbersome and difficult to operate ."
1,the sound is excellent as one would suspect from a creative product .
1,"the included eax support is useful at times , especially when you listen to a variety of genres , as it will adjust the equalizer for you which can be a big hassle ."
1,"the signal to noise ratio ( the ratio of detectable , useful data to unusable garbage in , say , a radio wave ; . a larger stn ratio is better ) is nice and high at 98 decibels , and it should be noted that apple refuses to release the stn ratio of any of the ipods ."
1,the software has n 't been a hassle for me at all .
1,"lastly , the price is fantastic :"
1,i uploaded the drivers and new software in 15 minutes - no crashes or problems .
1,usb 2 . 0 - very fast
1,but the sound is very good ( and loud ) and works well on my portable speakers .
1,and for those that are int rested the recharger works anywhere in the world ( and is quite small ) .
1,"it looks very cool , and seems quite small to me and very light ."
1,"the scroll button seems ok , i have no problems with it ."
1,i am very pleased so far .
1,very simple to use .
1,all in all suprisingly easy to use .
1,"lots of flaws , but exceptional sound quality , hd size , and price make it a good buy ."
1,excellent sound - i found the music reproduced faithfully through the jukebox .
1,"transfer through windows explorer - windows recognizes the jukebox as an additional hard disk , so it allows you to simply drag and drop files from windows explorer to a folder for the nomad ."
1,i found it very useful for transferring large files to another computer .
1,"huge storage space - even at 320kbs , you can store a ton of songs on this thing ."
1,having usb 2 . 0 makes for very fast transfers .
1,"i use it for ripping cds , which it does a pretty good job of ."
1,"overall , i feel that it 's a decent buy , and am happy that i own it ."
1,"for the price and size and features , you can 't beat the price ."
1,the buttons and interface are very easy to use .
1,"simple click buttons , back buttons volume and display are very easy to read , access and use ."
1,with this mp3 player you get much more memory for much less than an ipod .
1,i have found that the interface on the nomad is very easy to use if you have a basic knowledge of a computer .
1,i have had no problem what-so-ever with this product .
1,the software installed flawlessly and without any problems on my windows 2k machine .
1,"the battery life seems good , takes very little time to charge , it uploads mp3s quickly and there is no delay between songs ."
1,"took me a few tries to get use to the navigation , but it 's a very user friendly player imo ."
1,"i have n 't messed with the firmware at all , the player worked perfect for me right out of the box ."
1,"all-in-all , this is another excellent creative product ."
1,"it 's small , light and nice looking and the display is decent as well ."
1,i would recommend this product to anyone .
1,"before asking for the zen xtra specifically for christmas i researched many different mp3 players but finally decided on this one , and now that i have it i could n 't be happier and i 'm convinced it 's the best one out there ."
1,"many people have written about the software being its one downfall , personally i have n 't had a single problem with the software , i 'm running windows me ."
1,"the cd ripping to mp3 is so easy , and you can even rip the cd directly to the mp3 player , so it wo n 't take up space on your pc hard drive ."
1,"the software runs smooth , it 's nice to look at , it 's very organized , easy to follow and makes things very simple ."
1,"the controls on the player are very simple , no need for a manual ."
1,"the player is fast and sounds great , it also has many options like slowing or speeding up the music , or making it sound like you 're hearing the music in a huge auditorium ."
1,"the battery lasts very long when playing music , but writing files to the player drains the battery fast , so you need to have it plugged into an outlet when sending files ."
1,"playlists can be made on the fly , without aid of a computer , and you can use play modes like shuffle and repeat for your ' now playing ' selections or playlists ."
1,"the software could n 't be better and the mp3 player works like a dream , i could n 't give this anything but a 5 , i wish there was a 6 ."
1,it is an extremely cool cozmo .
1,well i have to say that this product is very good i mean it might be a little big but it still fits in your pocket .
1,well surely this is a product that i recommend someone in getting rather than any other mp3 player ( at that size and the price ) .
1,"not only is it more affordable , but its a better player for windows , which is what i have ."
1,"it hasn't gone below the second notch ( i charge mine whenever i 'm at home and not using it ) , so the battery life seems fine ( so far ) ."
1,oh . . . and file transfers are fast & easy .
1,it 's easy .
1,"the buttons are easy to use , and its easy to navigate ."
1,"the big backlight makes things easy to see , and the writing is big enough for people to see ."
1,my favorite thing about the nomad is the eax feature .
1,its really cool .
1,"sound quality is amazing . i was expecting worse , but its really good ( especially if your files have good sound quality ) ."
1,"you can also slow a song down & speed it up , which is cool too ."
1,"also , you can store data on it , which is a plus . for all you people who want to buy an ipod just to say you have an ipod , do n 't bother , this is a much better buy ."
1,first i 'll start off by saying that this players hardware is pretty good . . .
1,"while the ease of use was very impressive , i was put off by the price -- about $ 130 more than what i paid amazon for this player ."
1,"i have had the nomad jukebox for about three weeks now , and i am very happy with it ."
1,the storage capacity is great for me --
1,the bottom line for me is that i am very happy with this product .
1,"a lot of people complain about the creative software , but i actually find creative mediasource organizer to have some strengths over itunes ."
1,"first , the zen lets you sync to more than one computer ."
1,"the zen is an outstanding way to shuttle music between sources , you can 't do this on the ipod ( except for a cumbersome work-around using the ipod as a hard drive instead of a player ) ."
1,"second , the "" automatic "" sync on creative lets you review the songs before it begins its transfer ."
1,the zen serves as a back-up device as well as a player .
1,"third , creative software allows you to keep two windows open to look at both the content on the player and the computer ."
1,"for those of us that like to tinker , i think creative offers some advantages ."
1,zen allows you to scroll up and down the song list selected on the player .
1,it also lets you remove songs from the play order .
1,"if you bring up an album , but absolutely hate some of the tracks , the zen will allow you to delete that from the playing order ."
1,its ability to serve as a back-up for my music collection is a huge plus .
1,i got this thing for christmas and i have been very happy with it ever since .
1,the software is quick & easy to use & i found the entire process very easily mastered .
1,the unit works great with my cassette adapter for my car & is also easily worked without taking your eyes off the road ! .
1,overall it is a great unit & hopefully creative labs or some other vendor will soon come out with some accessories for it .
1,this did n 't bother me too much because it 's still a decent size .
1,it comes with a good case that fits it snugly .
1,extremely convenient .
1,great price .
1,i thought the software was decent enough - it was n 't complicated to learn at all .
1,i 'm really happy with this purchase .
1,"now he res the stuff you should know starting with the good things : the screen is really big and the blue light in the back is perfect , fast as hell in music transfer , controls are easy to use after mastering the scroll button , great sound and ive heard many mp3 players , a ton of different equalizer type deals on here ."
1,but it comes with a tank of a case and if you cut a piece out where the screen is you can always keep it in the case and still access everything .
1,"ive seen em all , the archos , dell , ipods , everything . . . good price and great sound makes this one the best in my opinion ."
1,* price and capacity
1,* slick-looking design and improved interface
1,* removable battery
1,"despite its being slightly larger than the ipod , i must say i was surprised to see how small it was when i unwrapped the box ! ."
1,"i am ripping my cd collection into 160 kbps wma files ; . this gives an average of around 60-65 mb per cd , good for about 900 cds in the ~ 57 , 000 mb of free memory available to me ."
1,"file transfers are fast , nearly a song per second via usb 2 . 0 ."
1,"to my ears , a 160 kbps wma file sounds just as good as the source cd , and the zen xtra sounds just as good as a portable cd player ."
1,"the eax features are pretty cool , as well , as creative has included a number of eq adjustments that , for example , compensate for the extraneous noise encountered in a car or on a train ."
1,"at the end of the day , what i wanted was a large-capacity player which allows me to easily play any album from my collection wherever i go , and the zen xtra 's combination of price , capacity and features easily meets those criteria ."
1,"i got this for christmas , and it is a great gift ."
1,"i have been ripping songs into it for the past few weeks , and the ease of use is wonderful ."
1,"the memory will hold an amazing amount of songs , my entire collection of cd 's will all fit on this great little tiny piece of digital fun ."
1,plusses are the easy to remove battery and the terrific sound produced by the nomad .
1,"ripping the songs , even with my 1 . 1 usb connection is still very quick , and the quality is very good ."
1,"considering the price and specs , this might be the best buy out there for a large memory mp3 player ."
1,"it 's really a shame , because otherwise , creative mp3 players are very good , and have the best sound quality of any players on the market ."
1,"after some consideration i chose the 40gb nomad zen xtra from creative , and i have not been disappointed ."
1,"first , the battery is replacable by the user , because creative intended it to be - unlike apple with the ipod ."
1,"it was easy enough to remove the front plate , and there was only one way the battery could be inserted ."
1,the new organizer software that ships with the nomad zen xtra could n 't be easier to use .
1,"you can create playlists , drag & drop songs and playlists to your player , and rip directly from cd to your player ."
1,"and with usb 2 . 0 , transferring music to your player is incredibly easy ."
1,"the sound is great , and the volume is more than satisfactory for commutes and shutting out external noise ."
1,"i thought i 'd have to buy a set of headphones to use with it , but the included earbuds work quite well ."
1,"they could be more comfortable , but no complaints in the sound department ."
1,i 've played around with the equalizer settings and am satisfied at the range of choices i have there too .
1,1 . i achieved my basic objective ; . my entire cd collection is on a portable device with lots of room to store more .
1,the zen has minimal stoppage between tracks ; . when listening to music that continues from one track to the next the gap is just a hesitation - a slightly audible click ; . if i am not listening for the progress from one track to the next i do n 't even notice the click .
1,"m3u files are used by most mp3 players like musicmatch and winamp , but not creative - without notmad you need to manually recreate your playlists ) ; . it does n 't care what software you use to rip or catalog your music - creative or any other company - all my 12 . 5 gb of music were transferred to the zen with correct tags - hooray ! ."
1,given that i already have the zen the only reason i am happy with it is because of the notmad software .
1,"now that i own it , however , i can 't imagine being without it ! ."
1,i have stored around 60 cd 's ( at 160kbps ) on this and have barely touched the available memory .
1,the sound quality is fantastic ( cd quality ) and it is really great to carry this around instead of stacks of cd 's or tapes ! .
1,it is exceedingly simple to navigate around in this device .
1,i did n 't read a thing about how to operate it -- it was just intuitive .
1,one other plus is that napster now supports this device via their software .
1,+ the memory ( 40 gb ) is staggering .
1,+ i had no problem using musicmatch software already on my computer to load songs and albums onto this unit
1,"+ screen was good , easy to read"
1,+ / - sound quality was good but it was going to take some tweaking with settings to try to make it great .
1,i decided to save the $ $ and opted for the zen xtra . . . and i was not disappointed .
1,the player is intuitive and outputs great sound quality .
1,navigation is easy and i found that syncing files from the player to the computer ( and vice verse ) was easy too .
1,many have complained about the software included but in my opinion it 's easy to use and effective .
1,i love this player and am extremely happy with my decision .
1,the price / performance looked just right .
1,i did buy the notmad software a week ago and found that a vast improvement .
1,"1 ) great sound ( > 98db signal-to-noise ratio beats ipod 's "" unspecified "" ratio ) and good power output allow the zen xtra to drive large head-phones as well as external speakers ."
1,"with my sennheiser 497 headphones , the volume is loud enough at 12 ( max is 20 ) ."
1,the player works well with my sony srs-a 202 powered speakers .
1,"2 ) the player user interface ( ui ) is intuitive to use , and allows easy navigation of a large or small collection ."
1,3 ) the nomad explorer ( winxp style interface ) works well to transfer files back and forth to use the nomad as an external although the tech support web-site states that the primary intended purpose of the player is as a player .
1,the nomad explorer provide most of the functionality offered by 3rd party programs like notmad .
1,4 ) usb 2 . 0 means fast data transfers ( 1 song / sec ! . ) .
1,"5 ) the cheap , user-replaceable battery ( $ 50 from creative ) is a great advantage over the ipod 's battery which costs $ 100 to replace ."
1,6 ) excellent battery life - 14 hours beats ipod 's .
1,7 ) chic look and good build - the player comes in a compact form with a metal face plate .
1,i use it primarily in the provided protective case although i have dropped it about 3 feet from my desk ( by accident ) as well as have played it outdoors in - 30 fahrenheit weather ( by design ) and it has continued to work fine .
1,"8 ) creative mediasource , although not as sleek looking as windows media player , is effective in organizing your collection and is linked to a good cb service ( gracenotes ) ."
1,i do n 't always care for gracenotes ' genre listings but it allows easy editing of id3 tags .
1,b . fast mediasource cd ripping - takes about 40 seconds for a cd on my pentium 4 pc ( 2 . 4 hz with 1gb ram ) with 52x drive .
1,c . i do love audio sync which allows a one-click synchronization between the player and the music collection on the computer .
1,9 ) wake-up feature that allows you to set up the player to wake up and play selected music at a specified time .
1,"10 ) multiple play modes - tracks in order of album , shuffle , etc . , is standard on all jukebox players but worth noting that the zen xtra is not deficient in this matter ."
1,11 ) minimal pause between songs - less than that on other devices - good achievement for a hard-drive based player
1,"12 ) big storage - my entire cd collection in one small device ( 5717 songs , 491 albums and counting ) ! ."
1,7 ) some people have problems with the flip switch on the bottom that releases the player cover - has not been an issue for me and is immaterial if you use the case as the case covers the switch .
1,"great sound ; . good interface ; . replaceable , powerful battery ; . good software ; . wake-up , sleep timers ; . multiple play modes"
1,can 't beat carrying 500-cd collection with me wherever i go .
1,also love waking up to music with attached speakers .
1,i felt better with this one since it had the shuffle feature and i 'm not too keen on www . ipod's dirty secret . com .
1,replacement battery is $ 50 compared to ipod 's $ 150 .
1,"i loved this product when i first got it - great sound , easy to use ( even though i agree that the software was n 't the best ) and held enough songs to suit any mood ."
1,"the combination of the price , storage size , and player features makes this player the best on the market ."
1,"fact is , it could n 't be easier to use ."
1,"sound quality on this is amazing , as with all creative products ."
1,even leaving it on the default setting ( without the eax enhancements ) produces crystal clear playback .
1,"the menu allows you to search for files by artist , genre , and album quite easily ."
1,"the battery stays charged for a long time , and takes no more than 2 or 3 hours at most to fully recharge via the included ac adapter ."
1,"connect the player to your computer ( via usb ) , open up mediasource , and you can listen to your stored mp3s as they stream directly from the xtra ! ."
1,usb 2 . 0 transfer is insanely fast .
1,my first impression was positive .
1,"overall , a good buy for the price ."
1,"easy enough to navigate through , although i 'd prefer a sturdier button besides the thumb wheel scroll / push button ."
1,"pros : huge storage capacity for the price , easy to navigate , can modify existing playlists on the fly , has a removable battery"
1,reviews for sound quality are generally ( but not universally ) positive .
1,"sure , this thing is definitely more cost-effective than an ipod ."
1,"our special friends at creative gave this thing good sound quality , great features , long battery life , and an unbeatable price ."
1,i bought the player this week and i like it by far .
1,removable and cheap battery - a li battery usually works properly for 1-3 years .
1,value : comparing data storage with price .
1,the appearance is okay ed ( at least not ugly ) .
1,the size is small ( just a little bit bigger than an i-pod . )
1,easy to use : a lot of reviews has mentioned about this
1,"the display is awesome , you can see everything you want and read it clearly"
1,"huge storage space , i loaded my entire collection of music , which isnt that much , 400 songs , and still have 26 gb , out of the 28 provided to you ."
1,"the sound is awesome , but if u put it too loud , depends on your sound quality , the sound might crack ."
1,"with eax on , you can modify your sound , with 4 different presets , which is pretty good , you can get different variations with it ."
1,"if you use software correctly , put in all the id3 tags , you will get an awesome database collection , from which you can easily access your songs ."
1,"i dont know what other people are saying , but the software is awesome ."
1,"battery recharge , is an awesome thing , because it recharges in only like 2-3 hours ."
1,"when you turn on your player , the player turns on really fast , and the music continues to play , as you left it when you were turning it off ."
1,"you can manage your profile , change the contrast of backlight , make different type of display , either list or tabbed ."
1,"you can do other different things with it such as choose what kind of "" now playing "" interface , you can see the interface as modern or classical ."
1,"there is an alarm , i still havent used it yet , but it should be good ."
1,"there is a clock , and date , which can get helpful ."
1,"the player has firmware , which will remove the glitches , if there are any ."
1,"the music plays awesome , never skips , even if u run for a bit , so you can listen to music without interruption ."
1,"and also , it 's priced very afford ably ."
1,"with 40gb of storage i have about 7 , 500 songs on the player ( everything music file i have is on there ) with room for about 2 , 500 more ."
1,"the software interface supplied was very easy to use but i went ahead and got red chair 's "" notmad "" software because of some advanced features i wanted ."
1,sound settings can be adjusted for personal preference .
1,accessing files by artist and album ( i mostly look things up by artist ) is easy and intuitive .
1,possibly the biggest advantage this player has ( if price was n 't enough ) is the fact that the user can replace the battery him / herself by opening the lid and popping in the new battery .
1,"since batteries do run out on everything , this will also be a big money-saver since ipods , rivers , rca , dell , all have built-in batteries that need to be replaced by a technician ( apple charges 100 bones for the battery replacement ) ."
1,"try before you buy if at all possible : although i am a mac addict now for over a decade and everyone i know has previously bought an ipod , the nomad zen xtra was a far better value and is just as easy to use with regards to both hardware and software interface ."
1,"i like the nomad 's color better , but it 's not terribly flashy ."
1,i have had mine for a month now and have to say i have enjoyed it .
1,price ! .
1,"sound quality is wonderful , i really like the smart volume sound normalization ."
1,i quickly got to use to the interface and can find any song / playlist etc fast enough .
1,i also liked the fact that you can save custom playlist you made on the player not just the computer ! .
1,have had the player since xmas's and love it ! .
1,"great sound , very long battery life ( i routinely play it for 12 + hours ) , very fast recharges rate , removable battery , storage size , nice screen , firmware updates , and great price ."
1,"this is an excellent player , especially for the price , with features that are comparable to and even excel the ipod ."
1,"for a price that 's still less than even the lowest level ipod i was able to get this 40gb monster , and the best part is it works as great as it was advertised to and then some ."
1,"the system is terrific in size and design , imo looking better than the ipods ."
1,"it 's very solidly built , and has a nice dense feel to it ."
1,i find all of the controls well-placed and not flimsy in the least .
1,"the scroll wheel is better than the ipod 's as well , in that you do n 't risk giving yourself a cramp running your thumb around in circles endlessly - just a small nudge of the finger and you 're there ."
1,the screen 's large and easily read .
1,"sound : exceptional , though i can 't really compare it to the ipod ."
1,interface - practically seamless .
1,yet after ensuring that all the id3 tags are in order ( with the software which is actually not as bad as people make it out ) it actually turns out to be really handy .
1,"playlists can be generated on the fly ( which is a bit clunky but still a really nice bonus ) or by using the software , and there are a bevy of eq options ."
1,"as i mentioned before , the creative mediasource software is actually really robust despite what others have said , though notmad may still work better ."
1,"it 's easy to transfer , preview , and organize files ."
1,"the in-program id3 tag editing is a strong point , as well ."
1,it was no problem for me to use their software .
1,"overall , i 'm giving this 5 stars as i 've seen nothing of the problems people have repeatedly cried havoc over , but as i 've only had the player for a while i leave room for doubt if the headphone jack , hissing , or scroll wheel problems show up with me too ."
1,please consider this much superior piece of equipment before plopping down half a grand for an ipod .
1,"honestly , i love this player ."
1,"because other people that complain about this player are talking bull , this player is awesome , it just breaks fast , which is horrible ."
1,the sound quality is very good .
1,having access to so much music where ever you go is terrific .
1,"works great , no odor , and uses regular bags ."
1,"so far ( 3 weeks ) , we 've had no problems with the diaper champ at all ."
1,it contains the smell from our baby 's diapers and we can use just about any kind of bag inside .
1,"i don 't know if we 'll run into trouble down the road with odors , but so far i have no complaints and i 'm very happy not to have to buy those refills ."
1,the diaper champ is the best we found ! .
1,there are no spec ail bags to deal with or buy ! .
1,we use the cheap $1 . 99 13 gallon vanilla scented bags from the grocery store but you can use any bag you have laying around .
1,we empty ours every day and we have never had an odors from it ! .
1,it is far better than just a trash can or the diaper genie and it 's fairly inexpensive as baby products go ! .
1,i love that you don 't have to purchase expensive refills .
1,"if i had to do it over again , even with the cost savings of using any type of bag , i would go w/ the diaper genie ."
1,it 's far better than all others on the market .
1,it 's easier and much more convenient to use because it doesn 't have clumsy and confusing ( not to mention expensive ) refills .
1,there is no odor and extremely easy to use .
1,1 . it uses regular garbage bags instead of brand refills .
1,3 . it never smelled - at all .
1,"the container is hard to open , which is exactly what you want when your baby becomes a toddler , and you do have to flip the handle carefully ( which has saved more than a few of her toys , too . ) i don 't consider these difficulties but features for the older baby ."
1,this is a must have product for all new moms ! .
1,this is easy to work and easy to dispose of the dirty diapers .
1,"it is much easier to fill and unload than the diaper genie , plus , why buy refills when you can use trash bags from the dollar store ? ."
1,it also holds a lot more diapers .
1,look at the size of it ! .
1,i highly recommend this ! .
1,i have to say that i am very happy with it so far .
1,i am happy with the fact that i can use any bag in there and dont ' have to pay out the nose for replacements .
1,it 's also so easy to use and holds a great deal of diapers .
1,the bags attach inside the champ easily and all one has to do is cram the diaper down and flip the handle .
1,i bought this diaper pail when my son was just a few days old and i absolutely love it ! .
1,the diaper champ couldn 't be easier to use .
1,and the biggest plus is that you don 't have to buy any expensive refills .
